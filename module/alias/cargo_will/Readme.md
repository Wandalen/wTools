Utility to publish multi-crate and multi-workspace environments and maintain their consistency.

### Purpose

1. **Multi-Workspace Consistency**: In a project setup involving multiple workspaces with shared dependencies, `willbe` maintains consistency. It ensures all workspaces are updated with compatible dependency versions.

2. **Publishing Multi-Crate Projects**: If your project structure includes multiple crates that need simultaneous publishing, `willbe` manages the process seamlessly. It ensures the crates are published in the right order while staying in version sync.

3. **Dependency Analysis**: `willbe` can perform a thorough analysis of your project's dependencies, providing a detailed highlight of inconsistencies or areas that need attention.

4. **Test Execution With Varied Configurations**: `willbe` can execute tests with varying configurations, such as different combinations of crate features. This assists in ensuring comprehensive coverage of test scenarios.

5. **Generate Health Table**: Quickly visualize important project metrics like build status for each crate, creating a single, easy-to-read table.

6. **Automating CI/CD Workflow Generation**: Automatically generate a series of CI/CD operations suitable for the task at hand to enhance productivity and improve the development process.
