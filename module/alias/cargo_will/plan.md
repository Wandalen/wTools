# Project Plan: Fix cargo_will crate

## Increments

*   ❌ Increment 1: Analyze the structure and dependencies of the cargo_will crate.
    *   Detailed Plan Step 1: Read the `Cargo.toml` file of the `cargo_will` crate to understand its dependencies.
    *   Detailed Plan Step 2: List the files in the `src` directory of the `cargo_will` crate to understand its structure.
    *   Detailed Plan Step 3: Read the main source file (e.g., `src/lib.rs` or `src/main.rs`) to understand the crate's entry point and overall logic.
    *   Verification Strategy: Ensure the commands execute successfully and the output is as expected. Manually review the output to understand the structure and dependencies.
*   ⏳ Increment 2: Identify and fix any compilation errors in the cargo_will crate.
    *   Detailed Plan Step 1: Run `cargo build` in the `module/alias/cargo_will` directory.
    *   Detailed Plan Step 2: Analyze the output of `cargo build` to identify any compilation errors.
    *   Detailed Plan Step 3: Fix any identified compilation errors.
    *   Verification Strategy: Ensure `cargo build` executes successfully with no errors.

## Notes & Insights
*   **[5/3/2025] Stuck:** Encountered persistent issues with building the crate due to dependency resolution problems. Initiating Stuck Resolution Process.

## Hypotheses

*   Hypothesis 1: The path to the `willbe` dependency is incorrect.
*   Hypothesis 2: There is a version conflict between the `error_tools` dependency in `cargo_will` and `willbe`.
*   Hypothesis 3: There is an issue with the workspace configuration in the root `Cargo.toml` file.
