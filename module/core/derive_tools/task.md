# Change Proposal for derive_tools

### Task ID
*   TASK-20250629-052111-FixDeriveToolsCompilation

### Requesting Context
*   **Requesting Crate/Project:** `module/move/unilang`
*   **Driving Feature/Task:** Architectural Unification of `unilang` (Task Plan: `module/move/unilang/task_plan_architectural_unification.md`)
*   **Link to Requester's Plan:** `module/move/unilang/task_plan_architectural_unification.md`
*   **Date Proposed:** 2025-06-29

### Overall Goal of Proposed Change
*   To fix a compilation error in `derive_tools` where attributes are not followed by an item, preventing dependent crates (like `unilang`) from compiling.

### Problem Statement / Justification
*   The `cargo test` command for `unilang` fails with the error `error: expected item after attributes` in `module/core/derive_tools/src/lib.rs` at line 193.
*   This indicates a syntax error in `derive_tools` that needs to be resolved for `unilang` and potentially other dependent crates to compile successfully.

### Proposed Solution / Specific Changes
*   **Inspect `module/core/derive_tools/src/lib.rs` at line 193:**
    *   Identify the attributes `#[doc(inline)]` and `#[cfg(feature = "derive_variadic_from")]`.
    *   Determine what item these attributes are supposed to be applied to. It's likely a missing `mod` declaration, `use` statement, or a function/struct definition.
    *   Add the missing item or correct the placement of the attributes to ensure they are followed by a valid Rust item.

### Expected Behavior & Usage Examples (from Requester's Perspective)
*   `derive_tools` should compile successfully without errors.
*   Dependent crates, such as `unilang`, should be able to compile and run their tests without encountering this specific compilation error from `derive_tools`.

### Acceptance Criteria (for this proposed change)
*   `cargo build -p derive_tools` should succeed.
*   `cargo test -p derive_tools` should succeed (if tests exist).

### Potential Impact & Considerations
*   **Breaking Changes:** No breaking changes are anticipated, only a fix for a compilation error.
*   **Dependencies:** No new dependencies.
*   **Performance:** No performance impact.
*   **Testing:** Ensure existing tests for `derive_tools` still pass after the fix.

### Notes & Open Questions
*   The `unilang` task is currently blocked by this compilation issue in `derive_tools`.
