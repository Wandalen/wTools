## Performance Improvements

Based on recent benchmark runs, SIMD optimizations provide the following improvements over scalar implementations:

| Test Category | Input Size | Improvement | Detailed Metrics |
|---------------|------------|-------------|------------------|
| Multi-delimiter 2KB | 2KB | 13.1x faster | Scalar: 2.62ms, SIMD: 0.19ms (12 MiB/s) |
| Multi-delimiter 10KB | 10KB | 29.5x faster | Scalar: 13.67ms, SIMD: 0.45ms (25 MiB/s) |
| Multi-delimiter 50KB | 50KB | 132.5x faster | Scalar: 95.27ms, SIMD: 0.69ms (82 MiB/s) |

## Bottleneck Analysis

### Critical Performance Factors
1. **Multi-delimiter operations** show the largest SIMD benefits
2. **Input size scaling** - benefits increase with data size  
3. **Pattern complexity** - more delimiters = greater SIMD advantage

### Real-World Impact
- **Configuration file parsing**: 15-50x improvement expected
- **CSV/log processing**: 20-100x improvement expected  
- **Data import operations**: 10-200x improvement expected
