## Issue Management Notes

This issue tracking system follows the inclusion criteria defined in the task management rulebook:
- Issues are reserved for bugs that are either **difficult to fix** (>4 hours investigation OR complexity ≥7/10) OR have **regressed at least once**
- Simple bugs are tracked via commit history, test documentation, and source comments only
- Each issue serves as a knowledge repository to prevent recurrence

For more details, see the task management rulebook § Issue Management.
