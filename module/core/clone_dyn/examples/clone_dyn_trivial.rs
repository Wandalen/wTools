//!
//! ## Basic use-case
//!
//! Demonstrates the usage of `clone_dyn` to enable cloning for trait objects.
//!
//! By default, Rust does not support cloning for trait objects due to the `Clone` trait
//! requiring compile-time knowledge of the type's size. The `clone_dyn` crate addresses
//! this limitation through procedural macros, allowing for cloning collections of trait objects.
//!
//! ##### Overview
//!
//! This example shows how to use the `clone_dyn` crate to enable cloning for trait objects,
//! specifically for iterators. It defines a custom trait, `IterTrait`, that encapsulates
//! an iterator with specific characteristics and demonstrates how to use `CloneDyn` to
//! overcome the object safety constraints of the `Clone` trait.
//!
//! ##### The `IterTrait` Trait
//!
//! The `IterTrait` trait is designed to represent iterators that yield references to items (`&'a T`).
//! These iterators must also implement the `ExactSizeIterator` and `DoubleEndedIterator` traits.
//! Additionally, the iterator must implement the `CloneDyn` trait, which allows cloning of trait objects.
//!
//! The trait is implemented for any type that meets the specified requirements.
//!
//! ##### Cloning Trait Objects
//!
//! Rust's type system does not allow trait objects to implement the `Clone` trait directly due to object safety constraints.
//! Specifically, the `Clone` trait requires knowledge of the concrete type at compile time, which is not available for trait objects.
//!
//! The `CloneDyn` trait from the `clone_dyn` crate provides a workaround for this limitation by allowing trait objects to be cloned.
//! Procedural macros generates the necessary code for cloning trait objects, making it possible to clone collections of trait objects.
//!
//! The example demonstrates how to implement `Clone` for boxed `IterTrait` trait objects.
//!
//! ##### `get_iter` Function
//!
//! The `get_iter` function returns a boxed iterator that implements the `IterTrait` trait.
//! If the input is `Some`, it returns an iterator over the vector.
//! If the input is `None`, it returns an empty iterator.
//!
//! It's not possible to use `impl Iterator` here because the code returns iterators of two different types:
//! - `std::slice::Iter` when the input is `Some`.
//! - `std::iter::Empty` when the input is `None`.
//!
//! To handle this, the function returns a trait object ( `Box< dyn IterTrait >` ).
//! However, Rust's `Clone` trait cannot be implemented for trait objects due to object safety constraints.
//! The `CloneDyn` trait addresses this problem by enabling cloning of trait objects.
//!
//! ##### `use_iter` Function
//!
//! The `use_iter` function demonstrates the use of the `CloneDyn` trait by cloning the iterator.
//! It then iterates over the cloned iterator and prints each element.
//!
//! ##### Main Function
//!
//! The main function demonstrates the overall usage by creating a vector, obtaining an iterator, and using the iterator to print elements.
//!
