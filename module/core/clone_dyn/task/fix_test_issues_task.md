# Change Proposal for `clone_dyn`

### Task ID
*   TASK-20250701-111230-FixCloneDynTestIssues

### Requesting Context
*   **Requesting Crate/Project:** `derive_tools`
*   **Driving Feature/Task:** Fixing `derive_tools` compatibility and re-enabling all tests. The `clone_dyn` tests are currently causing compilation failures when `derive_tools`'s test suite is run.
*   **Link to Requester's Plan:** `module/core/derive_tools/task.md`
*   **Date Proposed:** 2025-07-01

### Overall Goal of Proposed Change
*   To fix the compilation errors and test failures within the `clone_dyn` crate's test suite, specifically addressing issues related to unresolved modules (`the_module`), missing macros (`a_id`), and unrecognized attributes (`clone_dyn`). This will allow `derive_tools`'s test suite to compile and run without errors caused by `clone_dyn`'s tests.

### Problem Statement / Justification
*   When running `cargo test -p derive_tools --all-targets`, the build fails due to errors originating from `clone_dyn`'s tests. These errors include `E0433: failed to resolve: use of unresolved module or unlinked crate 'the_module'`, `cannot find macro 'a_id' in this scope`, and `cannot find attribute 'clone_dyn' in this scope`. These issues prevent `derive_tools` from compiling its test suite, blocking progress on its own task.

### Proposed Solution / Specific Changes
*   **API Changes (if any):** None. This task focuses on internal test fixes.
*   **Behavioral Changes (if any):** None.
*   **Internal Changes (high-level, if necessary to explain public API):**
    *   Investigate and resolve the `E0433` error related to `the_module`. This likely involves correcting `use` paths or ensuring `the_module` is correctly linked/aliased in `clone_dyn`'s `Cargo.toml` or test files.
    *   Investigate and resolve the `cannot find macro 'a_id'` errors. This suggests a missing import for the `a_id` macro, possibly from `test_tools` or a local definition.
    *   Investigate and resolve the `cannot find attribute 'clone_dyn'` error. This indicates a misuse of the `clone_dyn` attribute or a missing `use` statement for it.
    *   Ensure all tests within `clone_dyn` compile and pass.

### Expected Behavior & Usage Examples (from Requester's Perspective)
*   After this task is completed, running `cargo test -p derive_tools --all-targets` should no longer report compilation errors or test failures originating from `module/core/clone_dyn/tests/`.

### Acceptance Criteria (for this proposed change)
*   `cargo test` executed within the `module/core/clone_dyn` directory (e.g., `timeout 120 cargo test -p clone_dyn --all-targets`) completes successfully with no errors or warnings.

### Potential Impact & Considerations
*   **Breaking Changes:** None expected, as this focuses on internal test fixes.
*   **Dependencies:** May require adjustments to `clone_dyn`'s `Cargo.toml` to correctly link `the_module` or `test_tools` if they are external dependencies.
*   **Performance:** No significant impact expected.
*   **Security:** No security implications.
*   **Testing:** All existing tests in `clone_dyn` should pass after the fixes.

### Alternatives Considered (Optional)
*   None, as fixing the underlying issues in `clone_dyn` is the most direct approach.

### Notes & Open Questions
