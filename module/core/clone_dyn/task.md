# Change Proposal for clone_dyn

### Task ID
*   TASK-20250701-053219-FixClippyDocMarkdown

### Requesting Context
*   **Requesting Crate/Project:** `derive_tools`
*   **Driving Feature/Task:** Ensuring `derive_tools` passes `cargo clippy --workspace` checks, which is currently blocked by a `clippy::doc_markdown` warning in `clone_dyn`'s `Readme.md`.
*   **Link to Requester's Plan:** `../derive_tools/task_plan.md`
*   **Date Proposed:** 2025-07-01

### Overall Goal of Proposed Change
*   To resolve the `clippy::doc_markdown` warning in `clone_dyn/Readme.md` by enclosing the module name in backticks, ensuring compliance with Rust's documentation style guidelines.

### Problem Statement / Justification
*   The `clone_dyn` crate's `Readme.md` contains a `clippy::doc_markdown` warning on line 2: `# Module :: clone_dyn`. This warning is triggered because the module name `clone_dyn` is not enclosed in backticks, which is a requirement for proper markdown formatting and linting. This issue prevents `derive_tools` (and potentially other dependent crates) from passing workspace-level `clippy` checks with `-D warnings`.

### Proposed Solution / Specific Changes
*   **File:** `Readme.md`
*   **Line:** 2
*   **Change:** Modify the line `# Module :: clone_dyn` to `# Module :: `clone_dyn``.

### Expected Behavior & Usage Examples (from Requester's Perspective)
*   After this change, running `cargo clippy -p clone_dyn -- -D warnings` (or `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`) should no longer report the `clippy::doc_markdown` warning related to `Readme.md`.

### Acceptance Criteria (for this proposed change)
*   The `clippy::doc_markdown` warning in `module/core/clone_dyn/Readme.md` is resolved.
*   `cargo clippy -p clone_dyn -- -D warnings` runs successfully with exit code 0 (or without this specific warning).

### Potential Impact & Considerations
*   **Breaking Changes:** None. This is a documentation fix.
*   **Dependencies:** None.
*   **Performance:** None.
*   **Security:** None.
*   **Testing:** The fix can be verified by running `cargo clippy -p clone_dyn -- -D warnings`.

### Alternatives Considered (Optional)
*   None, as this is a straightforward linting fix.

### Notes & Open Questions
*   This change is necessary for broader project compliance with `clippy` standards.
