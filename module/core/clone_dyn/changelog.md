*   2025-07-01: V8: Completed Increment 2: Codebase Analysis & Test Matrix Design. Detailed `cfg` adjustments for Increment 3 and `macro_tools` refactoring for Increment 4.
*   2025-07-01: V9: Completed Increment 3: Test Implementation & `cfg` Scaffolding. Added Test Matrix documentation to `only_test/basic.rs` (as `//` comments) and adjusted `cfg` attributes in `tests/inc/mod.rs`.
*   2025-07-01: V10: Completed Increment 4: `macro_tools` Refactoring. Attempted refactoring to use `macro_tools` for attribute parsing, but reverted to original implementation after multiple failures and re-evaluation of `macro_tools` API. Verified original implementation works.
