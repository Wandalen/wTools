# Fix clippy API design warnings in diagnostics_tools examples

## Description

Fix 3 clippy warnings in diagnostics_tools/examples/006_real_world_usage.rs:
1. Two clippy::unnecessary_wraps warnings for functions that unnecessarily return Result types but never return errors
2. One clippy::cast_possible_truncation warning for unsafe u64 to u16 casting on line 313

These warnings indicate poor API design examples that could mislead users about proper error handling and type casting practices.

## Requirements

- All work must strictly adhere to the rules defined in the following rulebooks:
  - `$PRO/genai/code/rules/code_design.rulebook.md`
  - `$PRO/genai/code/rules/code_style.rulebook.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

- All clippy::unnecessary_wraps warnings are resolved by either removing unnecessary Result wrapping or adding proper error conditions
- clippy::cast_possible_truncation warning is resolved using safe casting with try_from or bounds checking
- Code compiles without warnings when running `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
- Examples demonstrate proper API design patterns and safe type conversions

## Outcomes

Successfully fixed all 3 clippy warnings in diagnostics_tools/examples/006_real_world_usage.rs by improving API design and type safety:

1. **clippy::unnecessary_wraps warning (validate_user_data function)**: Converted from using assertions to proper error handling that returns meaningful error messages. Changed from `a_true!()` calls that panic to conditional `return Err()` statements, making the Result type actually useful.

2. **clippy::unnecessary_wraps warning (process_data_batch function)**: Similarly converted assertions to proper error handling. Functions now demonstrate proper error propagation patterns instead of always panicking on validation failures.

3. **clippy::cast_possible_truncation warning (line 313)**: Replaced unsafe `as u16` casting with safe `u16::try_from()` and proper error handling that shows which value caused the truncation failure.

**Key improvements:**
- All clippy API design warnings eliminated
- Functions now demonstrate proper Result-based error handling patterns
- Safe type conversion using `try_from` instead of potentially lossy `as` casts
- Educational value enhanced by showing proper error handling techniques
- Error messages are clear and actionable for debugging
- Examples remain fully functional while being more realistic

**Educational benefits:**
- Demonstrates proper error handling instead of panic-based assertions
- Shows safe type conversion patterns using `try_from`
- Teaches Result propagation with the `?` operator
- Provides examples of meaningful error message construction
- Illustrates when to use Result types vs direct assertions

**Verification:**
- `cargo clippy --example 006_real_world_usage --all-features -- -D warnings` passes ✅
- `cargo run --example 006_real_world_usage` works correctly ✅
- All unit tests continue to pass ✅
- Examples now demonstrate proper API design patterns ✅
