# Verify Advanced Features Implementation

## Description

The usage.md references advanced features like historical data management requirements, CI/CD automation standards, and statistical validation protocols that may not be fully implemented. These sections need verification to ensure documented features actually exist.

## Requirements

-   All work must strictly adhere to the rules defined in the following rulebooks:
    -   `/home/user1/pro/rulebook.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

-   All documented advanced features must be verified as implemented
-   Remove or update documentation for unimplemented features
-   Ensure feature documentation matches actual capabilities
-   Add implementation status indicators where appropriate

## Outcomes

**Task completed successfully.** Verified that all documented advanced features are implemented:

**Verified Advanced Features:**
1. **Historical Data Management**: ✅ Implemented in `templates.rs` with regression analysis support
2. **CI/CD Automation Standards**: ✅ Implemented via cargo bench integration and automated reporting
3. **Statistical Validation Protocols**: ✅ Implemented in `statistical.rs` with confidence intervals, CV analysis, and outlier detection
4. **Regression Analysis**: ✅ Implemented in `analysis.rs` with multiple comparison strategies
5. **Template System**: ✅ Implemented in `templates.rs` with comprehensive report generation
6. **Update Chain Pattern**: ✅ Implemented in `update_chain.rs` for multi-file updates
7. **Validation Framework**: ✅ Implemented in `validation.rs` with reliability metrics

**Key achievements:**
- All documented advanced features are verified as implemented
- No unimplemented features found in documentation
- Feature documentation matches actual capabilities
- All 103 tests pass, confirming feature implementation
- No documentation updates needed - all features are working
