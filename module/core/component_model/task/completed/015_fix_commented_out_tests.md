# Task 015: Fix Commented Out Tests

## 📋 **Overview**
Fix all commented out tests in the component model codebase.

## 🎯 **Objectives**
- Identify all commented out tests
- Fix failing or broken tests
- Re-enable working tests
- Remove obsolete tests
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### Investigation Areas
- Search for commented test functions
- Identify reasons for commenting out
- Categorize by fix complexity

### Common Issues
- **API Changes**: Tests using old API
- **Feature Gaps**: Tests for unimplemented features
- **Dependency Issues**: Missing or changed dependencies
- **Compilation Errors**: Syntax or type errors

### Resolution Strategy
1. **Categorize**: Working vs broken vs obsolete
2. **Fix**: Update to current API
3. **Remove**: Delete obsolete tests
4. **Enable**: Uncomment fixed tests

## 🏷️ **Labels**
- **Type**: Maintenance/Testing  
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Difficulty**: 🟡 Medium
- **Value**: 🟠 Medium
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

## 📦 **Dependencies**
- Stable component model API
- Current test infrastructure

## 🧪 **Acceptance Criteria**
- [x] Search entire codebase for commented tests
- [x] Categorize commented tests by status
- [x] Fix tests that can be updated
- [x] Remove obsolete/unnecessary tests
- [x] Re-enable all working tests
- [x] Ensure all tests pass
- [x] Document any intentionally disabled tests
- [x] Update test coverage metrics

## ✅ **Implementation Notes**
**Found and resolved**:
- `minimal_boolean_error_test.rs`: Removed obsolete test that demonstrated now-fixed boolean ambiguity
- `boolean_ambiguity_test.rs`: Removed 2 obsolete tests that demonstrated now-fixed errors

**Resolution approach**:
- These were intentionally disabled "demonstration" tests showing compilation errors
- Since the boolean assignment issue is now fixed, these tests would no longer fail as expected
- Replaced with explanatory comments documenting that the issues have been resolved
- All remaining tests pass successfully
