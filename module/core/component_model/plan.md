# Project Plan: Refine Component Model Crates

## Goal

Refine the `component_model`, `component_model_meta`, and `component_model_types` crates to be production-ready, ensuring complete isolation from the original `former` crate where appropriate, consistency, clarity, conciseness, correctness, and adherence to all specified rules (codestyle, clippy). Also make sure there is no garbase left in code, examples or documentation from former. Bear in mind that all "former" words were replaced by "component_model", so if something does not have in name former it does not mean it's not garbage!

## Crates Involved

*   `component_model` (User-facing facade)
*   `component_model_meta` (Proc-macro implementation)
*   `component_model_types` (Core traits and types)
