# Unilang Crate/Framework Implementation Roadmap

### Current Status (as of 2025-11-24)
The project has successfully completed Phase 4 (Zero-Overhead Static Command Registry), including build-time validation to make illegal states unrepresentable. The framework now features compile-time prevention of duplicate commands and parameter storage mismatches (wplan bug pattern). Phase 5 work is in progress, with 3 of 4 milestones complete. The framework is production-ready for building high-performance, type-safe command-line utilities.

*   **Outcome:** A stable, maintainable codebase with a unified architecture, ready for the implementation of core functional requirements.
*   **Status:** All milestones are complete.

### Phase 4: Zero-Overhead Static Command Registry
*   **Goal:** To implement the mandatory performance NFR for a zero-overhead static command system, enabling utilities with thousands of commands to start instantly.

*   [✅] **M4.3: registry_refactor_to_hybrid_model:**
    *   **Prerequisites:** M4.2
    *   **Deliverable:** An updated `CommandRegistry` that uses the generated static registry for compile-time commands and a `HashMap` for dynamic commands.
