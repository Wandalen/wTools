## üéØ Concrete Next Steps for Task 001 Completion

### Phase 1: Move Semantics Implementation (High Priority)
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

1. **Modify former_meta setter generation**:
   ```rust
   // Current
   pub fn field(mut self, value: String) -> Self {
       self.field = Some(value);
       self
   }
   
   // Target  
   pub fn field<T>(mut self, value: T) -> Self 
   where T: Into<String> {
       self.field = Some(value.into());
       self
   }
   ```

2. **Test with real memory benchmarks**: Should achieve 30-50% runtime improvement

### Phase 2: Macro Expansion Optimization (Critical Priority)
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days

1. **Helper Function Extraction**:
   - Create `former_helpers` crate for shared logic
   - Extract validation functions
   - Reduce per-struct code generation

2. **Trait Bound Optimization**:
   - Use trait aliases to reduce compilation overhead
   - Implement const evaluation for compile-time computation
   - Cache common patterns

3. **Target**: Achieve <2.5x scaling factor for complex structs

### Phase 3: Integration Validation (Low Priority)
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day

1. **Real-world Testing**: Test optimizations with actual unilang builds
2. **Regression Testing**: Ensure all existing functionality preserved
3. **Performance Documentation**: Update Task 001 with final results
