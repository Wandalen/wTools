# Summary: Fix Lifetime-Only Structs in Former

## Overview

This is a summary of the tasks needed to fix the lifetime-only struct limitation in the Former derive macro.

2. **fix_lifetime_structs_implementation.md** - Detailed implementation guide
3. **lifetime_struct_test_plan.md** - Comprehensive test scenarios
4. **../../../macro_tools/task/add_generic_param_utilities.md** - Utilities to add to macro_tools

## Quick Problem Summary

The Former derive macro fails on structs with only lifetime parameters:

```rust
#[derive(Former)]
struct Simple<'a> {
    data: &'a str,
}
// Error: expected `while`, `for`, `loop` or `{` after a label
```

## Solution Summary

### Step 1: Add Utilities to macro_tools
- Add generic parameter splitting utilities
- Add functions to detect lifetime-only cases
- Add helpers for building ordered generic lists

### Step 2: Update former_meta
- Detect lifetime-only structs
- Generate different code patterns for lifetime-only cases
- Fix all impl blocks to handle lifetimes properly

### Step 3: Comprehensive Testing
- Add tests for all lifetime scenarios
- Ensure no regression in existing functionality
- Verify generated code correctness

## Key Implementation Points

1. **Detection**: Check if struct has only lifetime parameters
2. **Conditional Generation**: Generate different patterns based on generic types
3. **Proper Ordering**: Lifetimes must come before type parameters
4. **No Trailing Commas**: Ensure no trailing commas in any generic lists

## Priority

This is a high-priority issue because:
1. It's a common use case (structs with borrowed data)
2. The workaround (PhantomData) is not intuitive
3. It affects the usability of the Former macro

## Estimated Effort

- macro_tools utilities: 1-2 days
- former_meta updates: 2-3 days
- Testing and validation: 1-2 days
- Total: ~1 week

## Success Criteria

1. All lifetime-only struct examples compile and work correctly
2. No regression in existing tests
3. Clear error messages for invalid lifetime usage
4. Reusable utilities in macro_tools for other macros
