# Fix standalone_constructor_derive Test

## Issue
Test is disabled due to: "Requires standalone_constructors attribute implementation"

## Files Involved
- `/home/user1/pro/lib/wTools/module/core/former/tests/inc/struct_tests/standalone_constructor_derive.rs`
- `/home/user1/pro/lib/wTools/module/core/former/tests/inc/struct_tests/mod.rs` (line 232)

## Problem Description
The test requires implementing the `standalone_constructors` attribute that is not yet implemented in the macro.

## Investigation Required
1. Examine what standalone_constructors should do
2. Check if this is a planned feature or experimental
3. Determine implementation requirements

## Expected Outcome
Either implement the standalone_constructors attribute or document as future work.

## Priority
Low - appears to be unimplemented feature

## Status
Blocked - requires standalone_constructors attribute implementation
