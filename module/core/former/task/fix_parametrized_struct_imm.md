# Fix parametrized_struct_imm Test

## Issue
Test is disabled due to: "E0277 Hash/Eq trait bound issues with Definition"

## Files Involved
- `/home/user1/pro/lib/wTools/module/core/former/tests/inc/struct_tests/parametrized_struct_imm.rs`
- `/home/user1/pro/lib/wTools/module/core/former/tests/inc/struct_tests/mod.rs` (line 118)

## Problem Description
The test has a Child struct with generic K parameter that requires Hash + Eq bounds, but the macro-generated code doesn't properly handle these trait bounds.

## Investigation Required
1. Run the test to see specific E0277 trait bound errors
2. Examine how the macro handles generic parameters with trait bounds
3. Identify if Definition type needs Hash/Eq constraints propagated

## Expected Outcome
Enable the test by fixing trait bound propagation in parametrized structs.

## Priority
High - generic parameter support is core functionality

## Status
Blocked - E0277 Hash/Eq trait bound issues
