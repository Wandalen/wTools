# Fix subform_collection_playground Test

## Issue
Test is disabled due to: "E0277 Hash/Eq trait bound issues with Definition"

## Files Involved
- `/home/user1/pro/lib/wTools/module/core/former/tests/inc/struct_tests/subform_collection_playground.rs`
- `/home/user1/pro/lib/wTools/module/core/former/tests/inc/struct_tests/mod.rs` (line 181)

## Problem Description
Test fails with trait bound issues when using collections that require Hash/Eq constraints in subform collections.

## Investigation Required
1. Examine the specific collection types and constraints used
2. Check how Definition type propagates trait bounds
3. Identify missing Hash/Eq implementations

## Expected Outcome
Enable the test by fixing trait bound propagation in subform collections.

## Priority
Medium - playground test for experimenting with subform collections

## Status
Blocked - E0277 Hash/Eq trait bound issues
