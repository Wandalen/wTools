# Fix parametrized_struct_where Test

## Issue
Test is disabled due to: "E0277 Hash/Eq trait bound issues with Definition"

## Files Involved
- `/home/user1/pro/lib/wTools/module/core/former/tests/inc/struct_tests/parametrized_struct_where.rs`
- `/home/user1/pro/lib/wTools/module/core/former/tests/inc/struct_tests/mod.rs` (line 122)

## Problem Description
Similar to parametrized_struct_imm but uses where clauses for trait bounds. The macro doesn't properly handle trait bounds specified in where clauses.

## Investigation Required
1. Examine the specific where clause syntax used
2. Check how macro parses and propagates where clause constraints
3. Compare with inline trait bound handling

## Expected Outcome
Enable the test by fixing where clause trait bound handling.

## Priority
High - where clause support is important for complex generics

## Status
Blocked - E0277 Hash/Eq trait bound issues
