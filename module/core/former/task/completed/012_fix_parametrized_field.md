# Fix parametrized_field Test

## Issue
Test is disabled due to: "E0726 implicit elided lifetime + complex generic bounds"

## Files Involved
- `/home/user1/pro/lib/wTools/module/core/former/tests/inc/struct_tests/parametrized_field.rs`
- `/home/user1/pro/lib/wTools/module/core/former/tests/inc/struct_tests/mod.rs` (line 110)

## Problem Description
The test encounters E0726 "implicit elided lifetime not allowed here" errors, indicating lifetime parameter issues in generated code.

## Investigation Required
1. Examine the specific lifetime issues in the test
2. Check how macro handles parametrized fields with lifetimes
3. Identify where implicit lifetime elision is failing

## Expected Outcome
Enable the test by fixing lifetime parameter handling in parametrized fields.

## Priority
Medium - lifetime support in fields is advanced functionality

## Status
Blocked - E0726 implicit elided lifetime issues
