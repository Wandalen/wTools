# Fix Lifetime Parsing Error for Lifetime-Only Structs

## Issue Description

When deriving `Former` for structs that only have lifetime parameters (e.g., `struct Simple<'a>`), the compiler produces a parsing error:

```
error: expected `while`, `for`, `loop` or `{` after a label
 --> tests/inc/struct_tests/minimal_lifetime.rs:8:28
  |
8 | #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, the_module::Former)]
  |                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `while`, `for`, `loop` or `{` after a label
  |
help: add `'` to close the char literal
  |
9 | pub struct Minimal<'a'> {
  |                      +
```

This error suggests that the parser is interpreting `'a` as an incomplete character literal or label instead of a lifetime parameter.

## What Has Been Fixed

1. **Double Definition Issue**: Fixed the perform impl which was generating `SimpleFormer < 'a, Definition, Definition >` instead of `SimpleFormer < 'a, Definition >`.

2. **FormerBegin Lifetime Bounds**: Added proper lifetime bounds (`Definition::Storage : 'a`, etc.) to the FormerBegin implementation.

3. **Generic Parameter Handling**: Improved handling of lifetime-only structs in various places throughout the code.

## Current State

The generated code appears syntactically correct when extracted and compiled separately. The main structures are properly generated:

- `SimpleFormer < 'a, Definition >` - correctly defined with two parameters
- All trait implementations use the correct number of generic parameters
- The perform impl now correctly uses `< 'a, Definition >`

## Remaining Issue

Despite these fixes, the parsing error persists. The error occurs during macro expansion, suggesting there's a subtle issue with how tokens are being generated or there's a problematic token sequence that only appears during macro expansion.

## Hypothesis

The issue might be related to:

1. **Token Stream Generation**: There might be an issue with how the quote! macro is generating tokens, possibly related to spacing or token adjacency.

2. **Trailing Comma Issues**: The `struct_generics_with_defaults` includes a trailing comma (`'a,`), which might cause issues in certain contexts.

3. **Lifetime Position**: There might be a place in the generated code where a lifetime appears without proper syntactic context.

## Minimal Reproduction

```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, former::Former)]
pub struct Minimal<'a> {
    value: &'a str,
}
```

## Investigation Results

### Completed Analysis

1. **✅ cargo expand analysis**: The expanded code is completely valid and well-formed. All structs, impls, and trait implementations generate correctly.

2. **✅ Token adjacency check**: No issues found with token spacing or adjacency in the generated code.

3. **✅ Lifetime name testing**: The issue occurs with any lifetime name (`'a`, `'b`, etc.), not specific to `'a`.

4. **✅ Trailing comma review**: The trailing comma in `struct_generics_with_defaults` does not cause the parsing error.

5. **✅ FormerBegin lifetime consistency**: Fixed potential issue where different lifetimes were used in impl generics vs trait parameters.

### Current Status: UNRESOLVED

The parsing error persists despite all attempts to fix it. The error occurs during macro expansion, but the final expanded code is syntactically correct. This suggests a deeper issue in the procedural macro infrastructure or token stream processing.

### Key Findings

- **Error Pattern**: `error: expected 'while', 'for', 'loop' or '{' after a label` consistently occurs
- **Scope**: Only affects structs with lifetime parameters (e.g., `struct Foo<'a>`)
- **Expanded Code**: The final generated code is completely valid when inspected with `cargo expand`
- **Compiler Behavior**: The error occurs during compilation, not in the final code

### Hypothesis

This appears to be a complex interaction between:
1. The procedural macro token stream generation
2. How the Rust parser processes lifetime tokens during macro expansion
3. Potential issues in the `quote!` macro when generating certain token patterns

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Deep Token Stream Analysis**: Use `proc-macro2` debugging tools to inspect the exact token stream being generated.

2. **Minimal Procedural Macro**: Create a minimal proc macro that only handles lifetime-only structs to isolate the issue.

3. **Rust Compiler Investigation**: This may be a compiler bug or limitation that should be reported to the Rust team.

4. **Alternative Implementation Strategy**: Consider a completely different approach for lifetime-only structs, perhaps using a separate code path that avoids the problematic patterns.

5. **Workaround Documentation**: For now, document this as a known limitation where lifetime-only structs are not supported by the `Former` derive.
