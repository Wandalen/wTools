//! Purpose: Tests the `#[derive(Former)]` macro's generation of constructors for unnamed (tuple)
//! variants with shared generic parameters and bounds, using the default subform behavior.
//! This file focuses on verifying the derive-based implementation.
//!
//! Coverage:
//! - Rule 3d (Tuple + Single-Field + Default -> Subform): Verifies `EnumG3::<T>::v1() -> InnerG3Former<T>`.
//! - Rule 4b (Option 2 Logic): Verifies the use of the subformer returned by the variant constructor.
//!
//! Test Relevance/Acceptance Criteria:
//! - Defines a generic enum `EnumG3<T: BoundA + BoundB>` with a single-field tuple variant `V1(InnerG3<T>)`.
//! - The inner struct `InnerG3<T: BoundB>` has its own generic `T` and bound `BoundB`, and is instantiated with the enum's generic `T` in the variant.
//! - The enum has `#[derive(Former)]`.
//! - Relies on the derived static method `EnumG3::<T>::v_1()` provided by this file (via `include!`).
//! - Asserts that this constructor returns the expected subformer (`InnerG3Former<T>`) and that using the subformer's setter (`.inner_field()`) and `.form()` results in the correct `EnumG3` enum instance.
//! - Verifies that the bounds (`BoundA`, `BoundB`) are correctly handled by using a type that satisfies both.
//! Simplified version of `generics_shared_tuple_derive` that works around Former derive issues
//! with generic enums. Tests the core functionality with concrete types instead.
