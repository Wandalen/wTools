//! This module provides a comprehensive approach to applying the builder pattern to `VecDeque` collections.
//!
//! By leveraging traits such as `Collection`, `CollectionAdd`, `CollectionAssign`, and `CollectionValToEntry`,
//! this module abstracts the operations on vector deque-like data structures, making them more flexible and easier to integrate as
//! as subformer, enabling fluid and intuitive manipulation of vector deques via builder patterns.
