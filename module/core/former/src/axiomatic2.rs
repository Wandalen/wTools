//

/// A trait for initiating a structured subforming process with contextual and intermediary storage linkage.
///
/// This trait facilitates the creation of a subformer that carries through a builder pattern chain,
/// utilizing intermediary storage for accumulating state or data before finally transforming it into
/// a `Formed` structure. It is designed for scenarios where a multi-step construction or transformation
/// process benefits from maintaining both transient state (`Storage`) and contextual information (`Context`),
/// before concluding with the generation of a final product (`Formed`).
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// * `Storage` - Represents a mutable intermediary storage structure used throughout the subforming process
///               to accumulate data, state, or partial computations. This storage is internal to the
///               subformer and is eventually converted into the final `Formed` structure by the subformer,
///               not directly by implementations of this trait.
///
/// * `Formed` - Denotes the final type that results from the subforming process. This is the intended outcome
///              of the builder chain, constructed or transformed from the `Storage` with consideration of
///              the provided `Context`.
///
/// * `Context` - Specifies the contextual backdrop against which the subforming process unfolds. This could
///               encompass references to parent builders, configuration data, or any state influencing how
///               `Storage` transitions into `Formed`.
///
/// # Functions
///
/// * `_begin` - This function launches the subforming process, marking the start of a construction or transformation
///              sequence defined by the implementing type. It establishes the foundational `Storage` and `Context`,
///              alongside specifying an `on_end` completion handler that dictates the final conversion into `Formed`.
///
/// The `FormerBegin2` trait, by decoupling `Storage` from `Formed` and introducing a contextual layer, enables
/// sophisticated and flexible construction patterns conducive to complex data transformations or object creation
/// sequences within builder patterns.

  ///           into `Formed`, optionally utilizing `Context` to guide this transformation. It is crucial that this
  ///           associated type satisfies the `FormingEnd2<Formed, Context>` trait, defining the precise mechanics of
