//! Module `forming`
//!
//! This module defines a collection of traits that are crucial for implementing a structured and extensible builder pattern.
//! The traits provided manage the various stages of the forming process, handling the initiation, mutation, and completion
//! of constructing complex data structures. These traits facilitate the creation of flexible and maintainable formation
//! logic that can accommodate complex construction scenarios, including nested and conditional formations.

/// Provides a mechanism for mutating the context and storage just before the forming process is completed.
///
/// The `FormerMutator` trait allows for the implementation of custom mutation logic on the internal state
/// of an entity (context and storage) just before the final forming operation is completed. This mutation
/// occurs immediately before the `FormingEnd` callback is invoked.
///
/// #### Differences from `FormingEnd`
///
/// Unlike `FormingEnd`, which is responsible for integrating and finalizing the formation process of a field within
/// a parent former, `form_mutation` directly pertains to the entity itself. This method is designed to be independent
/// of whether the forming process is occurring within the context of a superformer or if the structure is a standalone
/// or nested field. This makes `form_mutation` suitable for entity-specific transformations that should not interfere
/// with the hierarchical forming logic managed by `FormingEnd`.
///
/// #### Use Cases
///
/// - Applying last-minute changes to the data being formed.
/// - Setting or modifying properties that depend on the final state of the storage or context.
/// - Storage-specific fields which are not present in formed structure.
///
/// Look example `former_custom_mutator.rs`

pub trait FormerMutator
where
  Self : crate::FormerDefinitionTypes,
{
  /// Mutates the context and storage of the entity just before the formation process completes.
  ///
  /// This function is invoked immediately prior to the `FormingEnd` callback during the forming process.
  /// It provides a hook for implementing custom logic that modifies the internal state (storage and context)
  /// of the entity. `form_mutation` is particularly useful for adjustments or updates that need to reflect
  /// in the entity just before it is finalized and returned.
