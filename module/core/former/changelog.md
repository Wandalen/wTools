* [2025-07-05 17:35 UTC] Fixed compilation error by updating `macro_tools::GenericsWithWhere` to `macro_tools::generic_params::GenericsWithWhere` in `former_meta`.
* [2025-07-05 17:38 UTC] Resolved compilation errors in `former_types` by removing incorrect test module includes and enabling required features for `component_model_types`.
*   [Increment 1 | 2025-07-05 19:05 UTC] Commented out `#[derive(Debug)]` attributes in `former_meta` and `macro_tools` (no direct instances found, but verified compilation).
*   [Increment 2 | 2025-07-05 19:06 UTC] Performed final verification of `former`, `former_meta`, `former_types`, and `macro_tools` crates. All checks passed.
* [Increment 1 | 2025-07-26 17:06 UTC] Setup handler files for unnamed enum variants.
* [Increment 3 | 2025-07-26 20:01 UTC] Added compile error for `#[subform_scalar]` on zero-field tuple variants.
* [2025-07-27] Fixed critical bug in enum variant constructor generation for generic enums. The macro was generating incorrect syntax `EnumName < T > :: Variant` instead of the correct turbofish syntax `EnumName :: < T > :: Variant`. Fixed in `former_meta/src/derive_former/former_enum/tuple_single_field_scalar.rs` line 22.
