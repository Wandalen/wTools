// former_custom_mutator.rs

//! This example illustrates how to use the `FormerMutator` trait for implementing custom mutations
//! and demonstrates the concept of storage-specific fields in the forming process.
//!
//! #### Storage-Specific Fields
//!
//! Storage-specific fields are intermediate fields that exist only in the storage structure during
//! the forming process. These fields are not present in the final formed structure but are instrumental
//! in complex forming operations, such as conditional mutations, temporary state tracking, or accumulations.
//!
//! These fields are used to manage intermediate data or state that aids in the construction
//! of the final object but does not necessarily have a direct representation in the object's schema. For
//! instance, counters, flags, or temporary computation results that determine the final state of the object.
//!
//! The `FormerMutator` trait facilitates the implementation of custom mutation logic. It acts on the internal
//! state (context and storage) just before the final forming operation is completed, right before the `FormingEnd`
//! callback is invoked. This trait is crucial for making last-minute adjustments or computations based on the
//! accumulated state in the storage.
//!
//! In this example, the fields `a` and `b` are defined only within the storage and used
//! within the custom mutator to enrich or modify the field `c` of the formed entity. This approach
//! allows for a richer and more flexible formation logic that can adapt based on the intermediate state
//! held within the storage.
//!
//! #### Differences from `FormingEnd`
//!
//! Unlike `FormingEnd`, which is primarily responsible for integrating and finalizing the formation process of a field
//! within a parent former, `form_mutation` directly pertains to the entity itself. This method is designed to be independent
//! of whether the forming process is occurring within the context of a superformer or if the structure is a standalone
//! or nested field. This makes `form_mutation` suitable for entity-specific transformations that should not interfere
//! with the hierarchical forming logic managed by `FormingEnd`.
