# Project Plan: Fix former crate tests

## Increments

*   ✅ Increment 1: Fix macro interpolation errors in `former_meta` enum handlers.
    *   Detailed Plan Step 1: Modify `module/core/former_meta/src/derive_former/former_enum/struct_non_zero.rs`. Assign `ctx.vis` to a local variable `vis` before each `quote!` macro call that uses it, and interpolate `#vis` instead of `#ctx.vis`. (DONE)
    *   Detailed Plan Step 2: Modify `module/core/former_meta/src/derive_former/former_enum/tuple_non_zero.rs`. Assign `ctx.vis` to a local variable `vis` before each `quote!` macro call that uses it, and interpolate `#vis` instead of `#ctx.vis`. (DONE)
    *   ✅ Detailed Plan Step 3: Modify `module/core/former_meta/src/derive_former/former_enum/struct_non_zero.rs`. Assign `ctx.enum_name` to a local variable `enum_name` before each `quote!` macro call that uses it, and interpolate `#enum_name` instead of `#&ctx.enum_name`. (DONE)
    *   ✅ Detailed Plan Step 4: Modify `module/core/former_meta/src/derive_former/former_enum/tuple_non_zero.rs`. Assign `ctx.enum_name` to a local variable `enum_name` before each `quote!` macro call that uses it, and interpolate `#enum_name` instead of `#&ctx.enum_name`. (DONE)
    *   Crucial Design Rules: N/A (Build fix)
    *   Verification Strategy: Run `cargo test` in `module/core/former` and check if compilation errors related to macro interpolation are resolved. Analyze logs critically.
*   ❌ Increment 2: Run tests and fix any remaining failures.
    *   Detailed Plan Step 1: Run `cargo test` in `module/core/former`. (IN PROGRESS)
    *   Detailed Plan Step 2: Analyze any failures based on logs.
    *   ✅ Detailed Plan Step 3: Propose and implement fixes for remaining failures. (DONE)
        *   Cloned `ctx.enum_name` before assigning to local variable `enum_name` inside `quote!` blocks in `struct_non_zero.rs` and `tuple_non_zero.rs` to fix `E0425` errors.
        *   Ensured all interpolations of `ctx.enum_name` and `ctx.vis` within `quote!` blocks use the corresponding local variables (`enum_name` and `vis`) to fix remaining `E0425` and `E0277` errors.
        *   Re-examined the `match` statement structure and indentation in `tuple_non_zero.rs` to fix the "unclosed delimiter" error.
        *   Drastically simplified `handle_tuple_non_zero_variant` in `tuple_non_zero.rs` to isolate the cause of the "unclosed delimiter" error.
        *   Fixed remaining `E0425` errors in `struct_non_zero.rs` by correcting `enum_name` interpolation in the `static_method` quote.
        *   Fixed "unexpected closing delimiter" error in `struct_non_zero.rs` by correcting brace matching and indentation in the standalone constructor block.
        *   Fixed `E0308` and related parsing errors in `struct_non_zero.rs` by moving `if/else` logic outside of `quote!` for `initial_storage_code` assignment.
    *   Crucial Design Rules: TBD based on failures.
    *   Verification Strategy: Run `cargo test` in `module/core/former` until all tests pass. Analyze logs critically.

## Notes & Insights

*   [Date/Inc 2] Struggling Point: Unable to apply diffs to add debug statements in `struct_non_zero.rs` due to repeated "malformed diff" errors from the `apply_diff` tool. This is blocking further investigation into why standalone constructors are not being generated for struct variants with non-zero fields. - Status: Unresolved
*   [Date/Inc 2] Hypothesis 3: The `handle_struct_non_zero_variant` function's logic for generating standalone constructors is somehow being skipped or is failing silently for struct variants with a single named field, even when the `standalone_constructors` attribute is present. This could be due to an incorrect condition check, a logic error in handling single-field struct variants in that specific block, or an interaction with other attributes or the variant's structure that I haven't identified. (Blocked from testing due to diff application issues)

*   [Date/Init] Initial analysis indicates compilation errors in `former_meta` related to `ToTokens` trait implementation for `EnumVariantHandlerContext` within `quote!` macros when interpolating `#ctx.vis`. - Status: Resolved
*   [Date/Inc 1] Verification revealed new compilation errors in `former` tests due to incorrect interpolation (`# & ctx.enum_name`) in code generated by `former_meta`.
*   [Date/Inc 1] Insight: `quote!` macro does not support interpolating paths like `#ctx.enum_name`. A local variable must be used to store the value before interpolation.
*   [Date/Inc 2] Struggling Point: Encountering persistent "unclosed delimiter" error in `tuple_non_zero.rs` after fixing interpolation issues. The error message points to line 216 and suggests an indentation issue with a closing brace. - Status: Unresolved
*   [Date/Inc 2] Hypothesis Test 1: The "unclosed delimiter" error is caused by the interaction between the `quote!` macro output within the `match` arms and the final closing brace of the `match` statement, possibly due to incorrect indentation or structure of the generated code in the `len > 1` arm. - **Result:** Rejected - **Reasoning:** Simplifying the generated code in the `len > 1` arm did not resolve the error, indicating the issue is likely with the overall `match` structure or surrounding code.
*   [Date/Inc 2] Hypothesis 2: The `unclosed delimiter` error is caused by an incorrect or missing token or structure immediately before or after the `match` statement in `tuple_non_zero.rs` that is interfering with the compiler's ability to correctly parse the end of the `match` block.
