# Project Plan: Restructure `former_enum_tests` Directory by Variant Type

## Goal
*   Reorganize the `module/core/former/tests/inc/former_enum_tests/` directory by creating three subdirectories:
    *   `unit_tests/`
    *   `unnamed_tests/` (for tuple variants)
    *   `named_tests/` (for struct-like variants with named fields)
*   Move existing enum test files into the appropriate new subdirectory.
*   **If an existing test file covers multiple variant types (unit, tuple, named), it must be split into separate files, each focusing on a single variant type, and then moved to the correct subdirectory.**
*   Update `module/core/former/tests/inc/former_enum_tests/mod.rs` and newly created subdirectory `mod.rs` files to reflect the new structure, ensuring all `mod` declarations point to the correct new paths.
*   Ensure all tests (even if internally commented out in their final locations) compile after the refactoring. The primary goal is structural integrity; test logic verification is for subsequent plans.
*   Preserve all existing test logic, including any currently commented-out tests (they will remain commented out in their new locations).

## Relevant Context

*   **Primary Directory to Refactor:** `module/core/former/tests/inc/former_enum_tests/`
*   **Module File to Update:** `module/core/former/tests/inc/former_enum_tests/mod.rs`
*   **Parent Module File:** `module/core/former/tests/inc/mod.rs`
*   **Existing Test Files within `former_enum_tests/`:** (Full list will be generated in Increment 1)
    *   Includes `_derive.rs`, `_manual.rs`, `_only_test.rs` patterns, and single files like `usecase1.rs`.
    *   Includes the `compile_fail/` directory.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   `module/core/former/advanced.md`
    *   `module/core/former/Readme.md`

### Expected Enum Former Behavior Rules (Full Set for Context)

(This section will be preserved as it's crucial for understanding the purpose of the tests being moved, even if not directly acted upon in *this* refactoring plan.)
1.  **`#[scalar]` Attribute (on variant):** ...
2.  **`#[subform_scalar]` Attribute (on variant):** ...
3.  **Default Behavior (No `#[scalar]` or `#[subform_scalar]` on variant):** ...
4.  **`#[standalone_constructors]` Attribute (on enum):** ...

## Increments

*   [âœ…] **Increment 1: Detailed File Analysis and Relocation/Splitting Plan**
    *   **Goal:** Analyze each file in `former_enum_tests/`, determine its new location(s), and plan any necessary splits if a file covers multiple variant types. Plan `mod.rs` updates.
    *   **Target Crate(s):** `former`
    *   **Pre-Analysis:** The `former_enum_tests` directory contains various test files, some of which may test multiple enum variant types (unit, tuple, named). A detailed listing and analysis of each file's content is needed to determine the correct categorization and identify files requiring splitting. Compile-fail tests also need categorization.
    *   **Crucial Design Rules:** Structuring: Organize by Feature or Layer, Structuring: Add Module Declaration Before Content, Structuring: Split Large Files Methodically (If Requested), Comments: Focus on Rationale, Preserve Existing Tasks, Comments: Add Tasks and Label Simplifications, Comments: Annotate Addressed Tasks.
    *   **Relevant Behavior Rules:** Expected Enum Former Behavior Rules (referenced for context on test purpose).
    *   **Detailed Plan Step 1:** Listed all files and subdirectories currently in `module/core/former/tests/inc/former_enum_tests/`. (Completed)
    *   **Detailed Plan Step 2 (Categorization & Splitting Strategy):** Analyzed each file to identify variant types and plan splitting/relocation. (Completed)
        *   **Files to Move (No Splitting Needed):**

        *   `module/core/former/tests/inc/former_enum_tests/unit_tests/compile_fail/mod.rs`: Create this file, initially empty.

        *   Remove all old `mod individual_file;` declarations.
        *   Add `pub mod unit_tests;`, `pub mod unnamed_tests;`, `pub mod named_tests;`.
        *   Add `pub mod compile_fail;`.
        *   Preserve existing module-level documentation (test matrices).
    *   **Verification Strategy:** User applies changes. Run `cargo check --tests --package former`. Expect it to pass (many "file not found" errors for tests are expected from the parent `inc/mod.rs` if it still tries to mod them directly, or just passes if `inc/mod.rs` only mods `former_enum_tests`).

    *   **Commit Message:** `refactor(former): Relocate and split named (struct) enum test files`

*   [âœ…] **Increment 6: Final Cleanup and Verification of Structure**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure the main `former_enum_tests/mod.rs` is clean, all original files from `former_enum_tests/` have been either moved, split and moved, or intentionally deleted (if their content was fully redistributed). Verify the overall project still compiles.
    *   **Target Crate(s):** `former`
    *   **Detailed Plan Step 1:** Review `module/core/former/tests/inc/former_enum_tests/`. Ensure no old test files remain directly in this directory (unless it's a top-level `compile_fail/mod.rs` or other non-variant-specific files). (Completed)
    *   **Detailed Plan Step 2:** Review `module/core/former/tests/inc/former_enum_tests/mod.rs` to ensure it only contains `pub mod unit_tests; pub mod unnamed_tests; pub mod named_tests;` and `pub mod compile_fail;` and necessary `use` statements/documentation. (Completed)
    *   **Detailed Plan Step 3:** Run `cargo check --tests --package former`. Address any remaining path or module system errors. The goal here is successful compilation of the new structure, not necessarily passing all tests (as most test `mod` declarations inside subdirectories are still commented out). (Completed)
    *   **Verification Strategy:** `cargo check --tests --package former` passes. Manual review confirms no test files/logic were lost and categorization is correct.
    *   **Commit Message:** `refactor(former): Finalize restructuring of enum tests directory`

### Requirements
*   **Adherence:** Strictly follow `code/gen` instructions, Design Rules, and Codestyle Rules.
*   **Focus:** This plan is *only* for restructuring files. No test logic changes or uncommenting of actual tests within the files being moved, unless necessary to fix paths after moving.
*   **Preserve Docs & Comments:** Existing documentation in `former_enum_tests/mod.rs` (like test matrices) should be preserved. All test code, including currently commented-out tests, must be preserved in its new location(s).
*   **File Splitting:** Files testing multiple variant types *must* be split.
*   **Incremental Verification:** Verify `cargo check` after each major step.
*   **Approval Gates:** Obtain user approval before starting each increment and after successful verification.

## Notes & Insights
*   This plan focuses on a structural refactoring to improve organization before tackling test logic.
*   The splitting of mixed-aspect files is a key part of this refactoring.
*   The actual uncommenting and fixing of tests within these new subdirectories will be handled by subsequent, focused plans.
*   The `mod.rs` files within the new subdirectories (`unit_tests/mod.rs`, etc.) will initially have their `mod` declarations for individual test files commented out.
