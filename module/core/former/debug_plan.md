# Project Plan: Debug and Fix Generic Enum Macro Expansion

### Goal
*   Identify and fix the root cause of the `comparison operators cannot be chained` and `proc-macro derive produced unparsable tokens` errors when `#[derive(Former)]` is used on a generic enum.

### Progress
*   üöÄ Phase 1 Complete (Increment 1)
*   Key Milestones Achieved: ‚úÖ Increment 1: Isolate the failing test case.
*   Currently Working On: ‚è≥ Increment 2: Analyze and fix the responsible handler.

### Target Crate
*   `module/core/former`
*   **Note:** The fix will likely be in `module/core/former_meta`. For this debugging task, `former_meta` will be modified directly as per the plan's intent, treating it as the effective target for code changes.

### Relevant Context
*   **Failing Test Case:** `module/core/former/tests/inc/enum_unit_tests/generic_unit_variant_derive.rs`
*   **Likely Bug Location:** `module/core/former_meta/src/derive_former/former_enum/tuple_single_field_scalar.rs` or another variant handler.
*   **Key Files:**
    *   `module/core/former_meta/src/derive_former/former_enum.rs`
    *   `module/core/macro_tools/src/generic_params.rs`

### Expected Behavior Rules
*   The `Former` derive macro must generate syntactically correct Rust code for generic enums, including those with `where` clauses.
*   The generated code must be equivalent to the manual implementation of the `Former` pattern.

### Increments

*   [‚úÖ] **Increment 1: Isolate the failing test case**
    *   Pre-Analysis: The `debug_plan.md` already identifies the failing test. The goal is to modify `module/core/former/tests/inc/mod.rs` to run only this test, speeding up the debugging cycle.
    *   Detailed Plan Step 1: Read `module/core/former/tests/inc/mod.rs` to understand its structure.
    *   Detailed Plan Step 2: Comment out all test inclusions in `module/core/former/tests/inc/mod.rs` except for `generic_unit_variant_derive`.
    *   Verification Strategy: Execute `cargo test --package former --test tests` via `execute_command`. Analyze the output to confirm that only the `generic_unit_variant_derive` test runs and fails as expected.
    *   Commit Message: `chore(former): Isolate failing generic enum test`

*   [‚è≥] **Increment 2: Analyze and fix the responsible handler**
    *   Detailed Plan Step 1: Systematically comment out variant handler calls in `module/core/former_meta/src/derive_former/former_enum.rs` to identify which handler is generating the corrupt token stream.
    *   Detailed Plan Step 2: Once the handler is identified (likely `tuple_single_field_scalar` or `tuple_single_field_subform`), analyze its use of `split_for_impl` and the `quote!` macro.
    *   Detailed Plan Step 3: Correct the handler to generate syntactically correct code for generic variants.
    *   Verification Strategy: `cargo test --package former` should pass.
    *   Commit Message: `fix(former_meta): Correct token stream generation for generic enum variants`

### Task Requirements
*   The fix must not introduce regressions in other parts of the `Former` macro.
*   The fix must be robust and handle all valid forms of generic enum definitions.

### Project Requirements
*   All verification must be done on a per-crate basis.
*   Do not run workspace-level commands.

### Notes & Insights
*   The error `comparison operators cannot be chained` is a red herring from the compiler, indicating a subtle token stream corruption.
*   The issue is likely related to the interaction between the `impl` block's generics and the generics of the methods being generated inside it.
