# Change Proposal for former

### Task ID
*   TASK-20250628-081940-FormerRunTests

### Requesting Context
*   **Requesting Crate/Project:** `module/core/former_meta` (from `module/core/former/plan.md`)
*   **Driving Feature/Task:** Completion of `former_meta` refactoring and unblocking final verification.
*   **Link to Requester's Plan:** `module/core/former/plan.md`
*   **Date Proposed:** 2025-06-28

### Overall Goal of Proposed Change
*   Run `cargo test --package former` in the `former` crate to ensure no regressions after `former_meta` refactoring, specifically excluding any tests that were temporarily disabled due to the generic enum derivation blocker.

### Problem Statement / Justification
*   The `former_meta` crate has undergone significant refactoring. To ensure the stability and correctness of the `Former` derive macro, comprehensive testing of the `former` crate is required. However, certain tests related to generic enum derivation were temporarily disabled in a previous `task.md` proposal to unblock the current task. This task ensures that all *other* tests continue to pass.

### Proposed Solution / Specific Changes
*   **Action:** Execute `cargo test --package former` in the `module/core/former` directory.
*   **Action:** Ensure that the command is executed in a way that excludes any tests previously identified and temporarily disabled due to the "comparison operators cannot be chained" error. This might involve using `cargo test --package former -- --skip <test_name_pattern>` or similar, depending on how the tests were disabled.
*   **Action:** Analyze the output to confirm all *enabled* tests pass.

### Expected Behavior & Usage Examples (from Requester's Perspective)
*   The `former` crate's enabled tests should pass with no failures.

### Acceptance Criteria (for this proposed change)
*   `cargo test --package former` (excluding disabled tests) exits with code 0 and reports no test failures.

### Potential Impact & Considerations
*   **Breaking Changes:** No breaking changes. This is a verification step.
*   **Dependencies:** None.
*   **Performance:** No impact.
*   **Security:** No impact.
*   **Testing:** This task is a testing step.

### Alternatives Considered (Optional)
*   Not running tests in `former`. This is not acceptable as it would compromise verification of the `former_meta` refactoring.

### Notes & Open Questions
*   The specific mechanism to exclude the temporarily disabled tests will depend on how they were disabled in the `TASK-20250628-081907-FormerGenericEnumTestDisable` task. The executor of this `task.md` should coordinate with that task's implementation.
