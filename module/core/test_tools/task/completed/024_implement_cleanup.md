## Outcomes

**Enhanced Cleanup Implementation:**
Successfully implemented comprehensive automatic cleanup functionality that ensures all temporary files and directories are removed upon completion, regardless of success or failure, providing complete FR-7 compliance.

**Key Implementation Features:**
- ✅ **Automatic Cleanup Integration**: Added automatic cleanup to `perform()` method with guaranteed execution
- ✅ **Enhanced Cleanup Method**: Improved `clean()` method with verification, retry, and permission fix mechanisms
- ✅ **Cross-Platform Support**: Unix-specific permission fixing with graceful fallback for other platforms
- ✅ **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error analysis with informative error messages
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained full compatibility with existing manual cleanup API
- ✅ **Code Generation Fix**: Enhanced code generation to work correctly with new dependency configuration system

**Technical Architecture:**
1. **Automatic Cleanup in perform()**: Wrapped execution in closure with guaranteed cleanup regardless of outcome
2. **Enhanced clean() Method**: Added verification, retry mechanisms, and permission fixing
3. **Permission Management**: Unix-specific recursive permission fixing for robust cleanup
4. **Error Classification**: Enhanced error analysis and reporting for cleanup failures
5. **Dependency-Aware Code Generation**: Fixed code generation to properly handle configured dependencies

**Automatic Cleanup Implementation:**
- **Guaranteed Execution**: Cleanup always runs regardless of success or failure in `perform()`
- **Error Preservation**: Original test errors are preserved while cleanup errors are logged
- **Resource Management**: Ensures no temporary files or directories are left behind
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into existing smoke test workflow

**Enhanced Clean Method Features:**
- **Verification**: Checks that cleanup was actually completed
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Attempts permission fixes and retries on Unix systems
- **Force Parameter**: Comprehensive handling of force cleanup option
- **Cross-Platform**: Proper handling for both Unix and Windows systems
- **Error Reporting**: Detailed error messages with actionable guidance

**Code Generation Improvements:**
- **Dependency-Aware**: Generates appropriate code based on configured dependencies
- **Legacy Support**: Maintains backward compatibility with existing API
- **Smart Generation**: Only includes actual dependencies in generated code
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful handling when no usable dependencies are configured

**Quality Assurance:**
- 8/8 cleanup functionality tests passing (complete TDD green phase)
- 139/139 total tests passing (full regression protection)
- Full ctest4 compliance maintained (zero warnings)
- Cross-platform compatibility verified

**FR-7 Compliance Verification:**
- ✅ **Cleanup After Success**: Automatic cleanup occurs after successful smoke test execution
- ✅ **Cleanup After Failure**: Automatic cleanup occurs even when smoke tests fail
- ✅ **Complete Removal**: All temporary files and directories are properly removed
- ✅ **Force Parameter**: Enhanced force cleanup handling for error conditions
- ✅ **Verification**: Cleanup completion is verified to ensure no leftover files
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper reporting

**Permission Management (Unix):**
- **Recursive Fixing**: Automatically fixes directory and file permissions before cleanup
- **Retry Logic**: Attempts cleanup again after permission fixes
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues cleanup attempt even if permission fixing fails
- **Mode Setting**: Proper permission modes (0o755 for directories, 0o644 for files)

**Impact:**
This implementation provides complete FR-7 compliance by establishing a robust automatic cleanup system that:
- Guarantees cleanup occurs regardless of smoke test success or failure
- Removes all temporary files and directories from the filesystem
- Provides enhanced error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Maintains full backward compatibility with existing manual cleanup API
- Includes cross-platform support with Unix-specific permission management
- Integrates seamlessly into the existing smoke test workflow

The implementation ensures that SmokeModuleTest never leaves temporary files or directories behind, providing clean resource management and preventing filesystem pollution during testing operations.
