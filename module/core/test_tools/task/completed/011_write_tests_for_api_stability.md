# Write Tests for API Stability Facade

## Description
Write failing tests to verify that test_tools API remains stable despite changes in underlying constituent crates (FR-3)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Tests verify that API surface remains consistent across versions
- [x] Tests verify that breaking changes in dependencies don't break test_tools API
- [x] Tests verify stable facade pattern implementation
- [x] Tests verify backward compatibility maintenance
- [x] Tests initially fail, demonstrating missing stability mechanism
- [x] Tests follow TDD red-green-refactor cycle principles

## Status
✅ Completed

## Effort
3 hours

## Dependencies
None - this is the first step in the TDD cycle for API stability

## Outcomes

**TDD Approach Implementation:**
Successfully created a comprehensive test suite following proper TDD red-green-refactor methodology. The tests were designed to initially demonstrate missing stability features, then guide the implementation of Task 012.

**Test Suite Coverage:**
- ✅ **API Stability Facade Tests**: Created 10 comprehensive tests in `tests/api_stability_facade_tests.rs`
- ✅ **Integration Feature**: Added `integration` feature flag for proper test organization
- ✅ **TDD Demonstration**: Included `should_panic` test to show red phase, later converted to passing test

**Key Test Categories:**
1. **Stable API Surface Testing**: Verifies core functionality remains consistent
2. **Namespace Access Patterns**: Tests that namespace changes don't break public API
3. **Dependency Isolation**: Ensures changes in constituent crates are properly isolated
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Validates existing user code continues to work
5. **Feature Stability**: Tests API stability across different feature combinations
6. **Version Change Protection**: Verifies API remains stable across dependency updates

**Test Quality Metrics:**
- 10/10 tests passing after implementation completion
- Full ctest4 compliance maintained (zero warnings)
- Comprehensive coverage of FR-3 stability requirements
- Proper TDD red-green cycle demonstrated

**Technical Implementation:**
- Comprehensive test coverage for API surface consistency
- Tests verify namespace access patterns remain stable
- Validation of dependency module isolation
- Feature-dependent functionality testing
- Backward compatibility verification mechanisms

**Impact:**
This test suite provides the foundation for FR-3 compliance by ensuring that test_tools maintains a stable public API facade that protects users from breaking changes in underlying constituent crates. The tests serve as both verification and regression prevention for API stability.
