# Task 021: Implement Cargo Command Execution

## Overview
Implement SmokeModuleTest execution of cargo test and cargo run with proper success verification (FR-6).

## Specification Reference
**FR-6:** The smoke testing utility must execute `cargo test` and `cargo run` within the temporary project and assert that both commands succeed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement robust cargo test execution in temporary project directory
- [ ] Implement robust cargo run execution in temporary project directory
- [ ] Add proper success assertion for cargo test command results
- [ ] Add proper success assertion for cargo run command results
- [ ] Implement comprehensive command output capture and handling
- [ ] Add proper error detection and reporting for failed commands
- [ ] All cargo command execution tests from task 020 must pass
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing perform() method

## Implementation Notes
- This task implements the GREEN phase of TDD - making the failing tests from task 020 pass
- Build upon existing perform() method implementation (lines 194-221 in current implementation)
- Enhance robustness and error handling of command execution
- Focus on improving reliability and diagnostics

## Technical Approach
1. **Enhance Command Execution**
   - Improve cargo test execution with better error handling
   - Enhance cargo run execution with proper argument handling
   - Add timeout handling for long-running commands

2. **Improve Success Verification**
   - Strengthen success assertions beyond just exit status
   - Add output validation for expected success patterns
   - Implement proper error classification

3. **Better Output Handling**
   - Improve stdout/stderr capture and logging
   - Add structured output parsing where beneficial
   - Implement better error message extraction

## Code Areas to Enhance
- Strengthen command execution in perform() method (lines 200-221)
- Improve error handling and assertions (lines 208, 218)
- Add better output capture and diagnostics
- Enhance working directory management

## Success Metrics
- All cargo command execution tests pass
- Cargo test and cargo run execute reliably in temporary projects
- Success/failure detection is accurate and comprehensive
- Error messages provide clear diagnostics for failures
- Command execution is robust against edge cases

## Outcomes
Task successfully completed. Enhanced the SmokeModuleTest cargo execution implementation in `/home/user1/pro/lib/wTools/module/core/test_tools/src/test/smoke_test.rs`.

Key enhancements implemented:
- ✅ Enhanced cargo test execution with better error handling and diagnostics (lines 214-250)
- ✅ Enhanced cargo run execution with proper argument handling (lines 252-280)
- ✅ Added comprehensive error analysis with cargo error classification (lines 286-305)
- ✅ Implemented test success verification patterns (lines 307-316)
- ✅ Added project directory validation before command execution
- ✅ Improved command output capture with structured stdout/stderr handling
- ✅ Enhanced error messages with context (directory paths, command details)
- ✅ Added success completion logging for better diagnostics
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with existing perform() method
- ✅ All 8 cargo command execution tests pass, confirming enhanced robustness

The implementation now provides superior error diagnostics, classifies common cargo errors, validates test success patterns, and offers comprehensive logging while maintaining full FR-6 compliance.
