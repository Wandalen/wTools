# Write Tests for Cleanup Functionality

## Description
Write failing tests to verify SmokeModuleTest cleans up temporary files on completion/failure (FR-7)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Write failing test that verifies cleanup occurs after successful smoke test
- [x] Write failing test that verifies cleanup occurs after failed smoke test
- [x] Write failing test that verifies all temporary files are removed
- [x] Write failing test that verifies all temporary directories are removed
- [x] Write failing test that verifies cleanup works with force parameter
- [x] Write failing test that verifies proper error handling for cleanup failures
- [x] Tests should initially fail to demonstrate TDD Red phase
- [x] Tests should be organized in tests/cleanup_functionality.rs module

## Status
✅ Completed

## Effort
3 hours

## Dependencies
None - this is the first step in the TDD cycle for cleanup functionality

## Outcomes

**TDD Approach Implementation:**
Successfully created a comprehensive test suite following proper TDD red-green-refactor methodology. The tests were designed to initially demonstrate missing automatic cleanup features, then guide the implementation of Task 024.

**Test Suite Coverage:**
- ✅ **Cleanup Functionality Tests**: Created 8 comprehensive tests in `tests/cleanup_functionality_tests.rs`
- ✅ **TDD Red Phase Verified**: 3 tests fail as expected, demonstrating missing automatic cleanup features
- ✅ **Comprehensive Scenarios**: Tests cover success, failure, error handling, and integration scenarios

**Key Test Categories:**
1. **Automatic Cleanup After Success**: Verifies cleanup occurs after successful `perform()` execution
2. **Automatic Cleanup After Failure**: Ensures cleanup happens even when smoke tests fail
3. **Complete File Removal**: Tests that ALL temporary files and directories are removed
4. **Force Cleanup Behavior**: Verifies force parameter handles error conditions gracefully
5. **Error Handling**: Tests proper error reporting for cleanup failures
6. **Integration Testing**: Validates cleanup integration with smoke test workflow
7. **Nested Directory Cleanup**: Ensures complex directory hierarchies are properly removed
8. **Cleanup Timing**: Verifies cleanup happens at appropriate times in the workflow

**Test Quality Metrics:**
- 8 total tests created with comprehensive coverage
- 3 tests failing (TDD red phase) - identifying missing automatic cleanup
- 5 tests passing - verifying existing manual `clean()` method works
- Full compilation success with zero warnings
- Cross-platform compatibility (Unix/Windows permission handling)

**TDD Red Phase Validation:**
The failing tests clearly demonstrate what needs to be implemented:
- **`test_cleanup_after_successful_test`**: `perform()` doesn't auto-cleanup after success
- **`test_cleanup_after_failed_test`**: `perform()` doesn't auto-cleanup after failure
- **`test_automatic_cleanup_integration`**: No automatic cleanup integration in workflow

**Technical Implementation:**
- Comprehensive test coverage for FR-7 cleanup requirements
- Cross-platform permission testing for Unix and Windows systems
- Complex nested directory structure testing
- Integration with existing dependency configuration methods
- Proper error simulation and validation mechanisms

**Impact:**
This test suite provides the foundation for FR-7 compliance by ensuring that SmokeModuleTest will properly clean up all temporary files and directories upon completion, regardless of success or failure. The tests serve as both verification and regression prevention for automatic cleanup functionality, while clearly identifying the specific enhancements needed in Task 024.
