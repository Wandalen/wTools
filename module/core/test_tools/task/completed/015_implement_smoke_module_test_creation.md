# Implement SmokeModuleTest Creation

## Description
Implement SmokeModuleTest utility capable of creating temporary, isolated Cargo projects in filesystem (FR-4)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement SmokeModuleTest struct and initialization
- [ ] Implement temporary directory creation functionality
- [ ] Implement Cargo project structure generation
- [ ] Implement project isolation mechanisms
- [ ] Handle filesystem permissions and errors properly
- [ ] All tests from task 014 now pass
- [ ] Implement minimal code to satisfy the failing tests

## Status
✅ Completed

## Effort
6 hours

## Dependencies
- Task 014: Write Tests for SmokeModuleTest Creation

## Outcomes
Task successfully completed. The SmokeModuleTest creation functionality was already fully implemented in `/home/user1/pro/lib/wTools/module/core/test_tools/src/test/smoke_test.rs`. 

Key implementations verified:
- ✅ SmokeModuleTest struct with proper initialization (lines 24-39)
- ✅ Temporary directory creation functionality (lines 110-191) 
- ✅ Cargo project structure generation with proper Cargo.toml and main.rs creation
- ✅ Project isolation mechanisms using system temp directory with random paths
- ✅ Filesystem permissions and error handling with comprehensive Result types
- ✅ All 8 tests from task 014 are passing, demonstrating full FR-4 compliance

The implementation includes robust error handling, proper cleanup mechanisms, and comprehensive documentation. The form() method successfully creates isolated Cargo projects with correct dependency configuration, supporting both local path and published version dependencies.
