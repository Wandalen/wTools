# Task: Fix Collection Constructor Macro Re-export Visibility

## Goal
Fix the collection constructor macro re-export visibility issue in the test_tools aggregation layer to enable proper macro access in aggregated tests.

## Problem Description
The test_tools crate re-exports collection_tools as a module (`pub use collection_tools;`), but this doesn't re-export the `#[macro_export]` macros like `heap!`, `vec!`, `into_heap!`, etc. The aggregated tests expect these macros to be available as `the_module::macro_name!{}` but they're only available at the collection_tools crate root.

## Root Cause Analysis
- ✅ Features are properly enabled: `collection_constructors` and `collection_into_constructors` features are active
- ✅ Dependencies are linked: `collection_tools` is properly linked to `test_tools`
- ✅ Macros are defined: Macros are correctly defined with `#[macro_export]` in `collection_tools`
- ❌ **Issue**: Macros are not accessible through the `test_tools` re-export path because `#[macro_export]` macros are exported at crate root level, not through module re-exports

## Current Failing Tests
7 compilation errors of type `E0433` in aggregated collection_tools tests:
- `the_module::heap!{}` - Binary heap constructor macro
- `the_module::into_heap!{}` - Binary heap into constructor macro  
- `the_module::vec!{}` - Vector constructor macro

## Technical Solution
Add explicit macro re-exports in `test_tools/src/lib.rs`:

```rust
// Add these re-exports after the existing module re-exports
#[ cfg( feature = "collection_constructors" ) ]
pub use collection_tools::{heap, bmap, bset, hmap, hset, llist, deque, vec};

#[ cfg( feature = "collection_into_constructors" ) ]
pub use collection_tools::{into_heap, into_vec, into_vecd, into_llist, into_hset, into_hmap, into_bmap, into_bset};
```

## Implementation Steps
1. **Identify Required Macros**: Determine which collection constructor macros are used in the aggregated tests
2. **Add Re-exports**: Add explicit `pub use` statements for the macros in `src/lib.rs`  
3. **Apply Feature Gates**: Ensure the re-exports are properly gated by the same features as the original macro definitions
4. **Verify Fix**: Run compilation tests to ensure the 7 remaining errors are resolved
5. **Full Test Suite**: Verify that the complete test suite can now run without compilation errors

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 7 remaining compilation errors from task 001 are resolved
- [ ] Macros are accessible as `the_module::macro_name!{}` in aggregated tests
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Full test suite compiles and runs successfully
- [ ] Changes follow the established code style and patterns

## Dependencies
- **Completes**: The remaining work from Task 001 (Fix Test Compilation Failures)
- **Blocks**: Full test suite execution for quality assurance

## Technical Context
This issue was discovered during investigation of Task 001 where removing `#[cfg(not(feature = "doctest"))]` gates resolved 140 of 147 compilation errors. The remaining 7 errors are all related to macro visibility through the aggregation layer, not the original cfg gate problem.

## Expected Impact
- **High Value**: Enables full test suite execution, critical for development workflow
- **Low Risk**: Straightforward fix that only adds explicit re-exports
- **Quick Implementation**: Should take approximately 2 hours including testing and verification

## Outcomes

**✅ Task Successfully Completed**

**Key Results:**
- ✅ **All 7 compilation errors resolved**: Fixed all remaining `E0433` errors from Task 001
- ✅ **Full test suite operational**: All 84 tests now pass successfully
- ✅ **Macro accessibility achieved**: Collection constructor macros accessible as `the_module::macro_name!{}`
- ✅ **Zero regression**: No impact on existing functionality

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Added explicit macro re-exports** in `test_tools/src/lib.rs`:
  - Constructor macros: `heap`, `vec`, `bmap`, `bset`, `hmap`, `hset`, `llist`, `deque`
  - Into-constructor macros: `into_heap`, `into_vec`, `into_bmap`, `into_bset`, `into_hmap`, `into_hset`, `into_llist`, `into_vecd`
- **Applied proper feature gating**: Both `collection_constructors` and `collection_into_constructors` features
- **Maintained build configuration consistency**: Same cfg attributes as other re-exports

**Test Results:**
- **Compilation**: ✅ Clean compilation with no errors or warnings
- **Test Execution**: ✅ 84 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored
- **Doc Tests**: ✅ 4 doc tests passed successfully
- **Previous Functionality**: ✅ All existing tests continue to pass

**Root Cause Resolution:**
The issue was that `#[macro_export]` macros are exported at the crate root level, not through module re-exports. The `pub use collection_tools;` statement re-exported the module but not the macros. Adding explicit macro re-exports made them accessible through the `test_tools` aggregation layer.

**Development Impact:**
- **Complete test coverage**: Full test suite now executable for quality assurance
- **Development workflow**: Unblocked test-driven development process  
- **CI/CD readiness**: Test suite can be integrated into automated workflows
- **Foundation for future work**: Enables confident development on top of working test infrastructure
