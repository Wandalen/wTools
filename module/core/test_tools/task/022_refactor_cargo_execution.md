# Task 022: Refactor Cargo Execution Error Handling

## Overview
Refactor cargo command execution to improve error handling and logging (FR-6).

## Specification Reference
**FR-6:** The smoke testing utility must execute `cargo test` and `cargo run` within the temporary project and assert that both commands succeed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Improve organization of cargo command execution logic
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation for command execution flow
- [ ] Optimize error handling with better error types and messages
- [ ] Enhance logging and diagnostics for command failures
- [ ] Create clear separation between test and run execution phases
- [ ] Add retry mechanisms for transient failures
- [ ] Ensure command execution is maintainable and debuggable
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for command execution failures

## Implementation Notes
- This task implements the REFACTOR phase of TDD
- Focus on code quality, maintainability, and documentation
- Preserve all existing functionality while improving structure
- Consider reliability and debuggability improvements

## Refactoring Areas
1. **Code Organization**
   - Separate cargo test and cargo run execution into distinct methods
   - Extract common command execution patterns
   - Improve error handling structure

2. **Documentation**
   - Add detailed comments explaining command execution strategy
   - Document common failure modes and their resolution
   - Provide examples of successful execution patterns

3. **Error Handling**
   - Create custom error types for different failure modes
   - Improve error messages with actionable guidance
   - Add structured logging for better diagnostics

4. **Reliability**
   - Add retry mechanisms for transient network/filesystem issues
   - Implement timeout handling for hanging commands
   - Add validation for command prerequisites

## Related Tasks
- **Previous:** Task 021 - Implement Cargo Command Execution
- **Context:** Completes the TDD cycle for specification requirement FR-6
- **Followed by:** Tasks for FR-7 (Cleanup Functionality)

## Success Metrics
- Cargo execution code is well-organized and documented
- Error handling provides clear, actionable feedback
- Command execution is reliable and handles edge cases gracefully
- Logging provides sufficient information for debugging failures
- Code review feedback is positive regarding maintainability
