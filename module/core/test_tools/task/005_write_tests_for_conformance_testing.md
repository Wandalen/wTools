# Write Tests for Conformance Testing Mechanism

## Description
Write failing tests to verify that original test suites of constituent sub-modules can be executed against test_tools re-exported APIs (FR-1)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tests verify that original test suites from error_tools can execute against test_tools re-exports
- [ ] Tests verify that original test suites from collection_tools can execute against test_tools re-exports  
- [ ] Tests verify that original test suites from impls_index can execute against test_tools re-exports
- [ ] Tests verify that original test suites from mem_tools can execute against test_tools re-exports
- [ ] Tests verify that original test suites from typing_tools can execute against test_tools re-exports
- [ ] Tests verify that original test suites from diagnostics_tools can execute against test_tools re-exports
- [ ] Tests initially fail, demonstrating missing conformance mechanism
- [ ] Tests follow TDD red-green-refactor cycle principles

## Status
ðŸ“‹ Ready for implementation

## Effort
3 hours

## Dependencies
None - this is the first step in the TDD cycle for conformance testing
