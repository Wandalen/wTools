# Task 036: Implement Local and Published Smoke Testing

## Overview
Implement automated smoke testing functionality for both local path and published registry versions (US-3).

## Specification Reference
**US-3:** As a Crate Developer, I want to run an automated smoke test against both the local and the recently published version of my crate, so that I can quickly verify that the release was successful and the crate is usable by consumers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement local smoke testing using path-based dependencies
- [ ] Implement published smoke testing using registry versions
- [ ] Add automated execution framework for both testing modes
- [ ] Implement release validation workflow integration
- [ ] Add consumer usability verification functionality
- [ ] Implement proper version handling and validation
- [ ] All local and published smoke testing tests from task 035 must pass
- [ ] Maintain compatibility with existing smoke test infrastructure

## Implementation Notes
- This task implements the GREEN phase of TDD - making the failing tests from task 035 pass
- Build upon existing smoke_test_for_local_run() and smoke_test_for_published_run() functions
- Enhance automation and integration capabilities
- Focus on providing comprehensive release validation

## Technical Approach
1. **Local Smoke Testing Enhancement**
   - Improve local path dependency configuration
   - Add validation for local crate state before testing
   - Implement proper workspace-relative path handling

2. **Published Smoke Testing Enhancement**
   - Improve registry version dependency configuration
   - Add validation for published version availability
   - Implement proper version resolution and validation

3. **Automated Execution Framework**
   - Create unified interface for running both local and published tests
   - Add progress reporting and result aggregation
   - Implement proper error handling and recovery

## Code Areas to Enhance
- Strengthen existing smoke_test_for_local_run() function
- Enhance smoke_test_for_published_run() function
- Add automation framework for coordinated execution
- Improve version handling and validation

## Success Metrics
- All local and published smoke testing tests pass
- Local smoke testing validates path-based dependencies correctly
- Published smoke testing validates registry versions correctly
- Automated execution provides comprehensive release validation
- Consumer usability is effectively verified for both modes
