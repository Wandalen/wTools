# Task 019: Refactor Cargo.toml Configuration Logic

## Overview
Refactor Cargo.toml configuration implementation for better maintainability (FR-5).

## Specification Reference
**FR-5:** The smoke testing utility must be able to configure the temporary project's `Cargo.toml` to depend on either a local, path-based version of a crate or a published, version-based version from a registry.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Improve organization of Cargo.toml configuration logic
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation for dependency configuration
- [ ] Optimize configuration generation performance
- [ ] Enhance maintainability of template handling
- [ ] Create clear separation between local and published configuration modes
- [ ] Add validation for Cargo.toml format correctness
- [ ] Ensure configuration logic is extensible for future needs
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for configuration issues

## Implementation Notes
- This task implements the REFACTOR phase of TDD
- Focus on code quality, maintainability, and documentation
- Preserve all existing functionality while improving structure
- Consider usability and performance improvements

## Refactoring Areas
1. **Code Organization**
   - Separate concerns between dependency resolution and template generation
   - Extract configuration logic into helper methods
   - Improve error handling for invalid configurations

2. **Documentation**
   - Add detailed comments explaining configuration choices
   - Document platform-specific handling strategies
   - Provide examples for different dependency scenarios

3. **Performance**
   - Optimize template generation for faster execution
   - Cache common configuration patterns
   - Use efficient string formatting approaches

4. **Maintainability**
   - Create templates for adding new dependency types
   - Establish clear patterns for configuration validation
   - Add automated testing for generated Cargo.toml validity

- **Context:** Completes the TDD cycle for specification requirement FR-5
- **Followed by:** Tasks for FR-6 (Cargo Command Execution)

## Success Metrics
- Cargo.toml configuration code is well-organized and documented
- Configuration logic is easily extensible for new dependency types
- Performance is optimized for common usage patterns
- Generated Cargo.toml files are consistently valid and functional
- Code review feedback is positive regarding maintainability
