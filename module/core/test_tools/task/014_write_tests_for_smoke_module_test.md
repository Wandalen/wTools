- [ ] Tests verify isolation from main project
- [ ] Tests verify proper Cargo project initialization
- [ ] Tests verify filesystem permissions and access
- [ ] Tests initially fail, demonstrating missing SmokeModuleTest functionality
- [ ] Tests follow TDD red-green-refactor cycle principles

## Status
ðŸ“‹ Ready for implementation

## Effort
4 hours
