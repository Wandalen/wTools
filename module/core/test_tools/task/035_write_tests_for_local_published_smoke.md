# Task 035: Write Tests for Local and Published Smoke Testing

## Overview
Write failing tests to verify automated smoke testing against both local and published crate versions (US-3).

## Specification Reference
**US-3:** As a Crate Developer, I want to run an automated smoke test against both the local and the recently published version of my crate, so that I can quickly verify that the release was successful and the crate is usable by consumers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies local smoke testing against path-based dependencies
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies published smoke testing against registry versions
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies automated execution of both local and published tests
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies proper release validation workflow
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies consumer usability verification
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies proper handling of version mismatches
- [ ] Tests should initially fail to demonstrate TDD Red phase
- [ ] Tests should be organized in tests/local_published_smoke.rs module

## Test Structure
```rust
#[test]
fn test_local_smoke_testing() {
    // Should fail initially - implementation in task 036
    // Verify local smoke testing uses path-based dependencies correctly
}

#[test]
fn test_published_smoke_testing() {
    // Should fail initially - implementation in task 036
    // Verify published smoke testing uses registry versions correctly
}

#[test]
fn test_automated_dual_execution() {
    // Should fail initially - implementation in task 036
    // Verify both local and published tests can be run automatically
}

#[test]
fn test_release_validation_workflow() {
    // Should fail initially - implementation in task 036
    // Verify smoke tests provide effective release validation
}

#[test]
fn test_consumer_usability_verification() {
    // Should fail initially - implementation in task 036
    // Verify smoke tests validate crate usability from consumer perspective
}
```
