# Task 033: Implement Behavioral Equivalence Verification

## Overview
Implement verification mechanism to ensure re-exported tools are behaviorally identical to originals (US-2).

## Specification Reference
**US-2:** As a Crate Developer, I want to be confident that the assertions and tools re-exported by `test_tools` are identical in behavior to their original sources, so that I can refactor my code to use `test_tools` without introducing subtle bugs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement verification that error_tools assertions behave identically via test_tools
- [ ] Implement verification that collection_tools utilities behave identically via test_tools
- [ ] Implement verification that diagnostics_tools assertions behave identically via test_tools
- [ ] Implement verification that impls_index macros behave identically via test_tools
- [ ] Implement verification that mem_tools utilities behave identically via test_tools
- [ ] Implement verification that typing_tools utilities behave identically via test_tools
- [ ] Implement automated testing framework for behavioral equivalence
- [ ] All behavioral equivalence tests from task 032 must pass

## Implementation Notes
- This task implements the GREEN phase of TDD - making the failing tests from task 032 pass
- Focus on proving identical behavior between direct and re-exported access
- Implement comprehensive testing framework for equivalence verification
- Consider edge cases and error conditions for complete verification

## Technical Approach
1. **Equivalence Testing Framework**
   - Create systematic testing approach for behavioral equivalence
   - Implement comparative testing between direct and re-exported access
   - Add comprehensive test coverage for all re-exported utilities

2. **Behavior Verification**
   - Test identical outputs for same inputs
   - Verify identical error messages and panic behavior
   - Compare performance characteristics where relevant

3. **Automated Verification**
   - Implement continuous verification as part of test suite
   - Add regression prevention for behavioral equivalence
   - Create comprehensive test matrix for all constituent utilities

## Success Metrics
- All behavioral equivalence tests pass
- Re-exported tools behave identically to their original sources
- Comprehensive verification covers all edge cases and error conditions
- Automated testing prevents behavioral regressions
- Developers can refactor to test_tools with confidence
