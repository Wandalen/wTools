# Task 031: Refactor Single Dependency Interface

## Overview
Refactor single dependency interface for improved usability and documentation (US-1).

## Specification Reference
**US-1:** As a Crate Developer, I want to depend on a single `test_tools` crate to get access to all common testing utilities, so that I can simplify my dev-dependencies and not have to import multiple foundational crates.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Improve organization of single dependency interface
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation for utility access patterns
- [ ] Optimize interface design for common testing workflows
- [ ] Enhance discoverability of testing utilities
- [ ] Create clear usage examples for different testing scenarios
- [ ] Add migration guide from constituent crate dependencies
- [ ] Ensure interface design scales well with future utility additions
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for dependency resolution issues

## Implementation Notes
- This task implements the REFACTOR phase of TDD
- Focus on code quality, maintainability, and documentation
- Preserve all existing functionality while improving usability
- Consider developer experience and discoverability

## Refactoring Areas
1. **Interface Organization**
   - Organize utility re-exports logically by functionality
   - Group related utilities for better discoverability
   - Improve namespace structure for intuitive access

2. **Documentation**
   - Add detailed comments explaining utility categories
   - Document common testing patterns and their implementations
   - Provide comprehensive examples for different testing scenarios

3. **Usability**
   - Optimize import patterns for common workflows
   - Consider convenience re-exports for frequently used combinations
   - Add helpful type aliases and shortcuts

4. **Migration Support**
   - Create clear migration guide from direct constituent dependencies
   - Document equivalent imports for common patterns
   - Add compatibility notes for version differences
