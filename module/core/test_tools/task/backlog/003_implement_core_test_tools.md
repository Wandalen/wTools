# Task: Implement Core Test Tools

### Goal
Implement a set of test tools for the core library.

### Requirements
*   Provide functions for generating test data.
*   Provide macros for simplifying common test patterns.

### Implementation Notes
*   Consider using the `fake` crate for generating test data.
*   Implement macros for asserting equality and inequality.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test data generation functions are implemented
- [ ] Common test pattern macros are created
- [ ] Documentation is complete for all new functionality
- [ ] Integration tests verify the test tools work correctly

### Technical Approach
1. **Research Phase**: Analyze existing test patterns in the codebase
2. **Design Phase**: Define the API for test data generation and macros  
3. **Implementation Phase**: Write the core functionality
4. **Testing Phase**: Create comprehensive tests for the new tools
5. **Documentation Phase**: Document usage and examples
