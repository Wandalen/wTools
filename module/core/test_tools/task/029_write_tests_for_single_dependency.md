# Write Tests for Single Dependency Access

## Description
Write failing tests to verify developers can access all testing utilities through single test_tools dependency (US-1)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tests verify all error_tools utilities accessible via test_tools
- [ ] Tests verify all collection_tools utilities accessible via test_tools
- [ ] Tests verify all impls_index utilities accessible via test_tools
- [ ] Tests verify all mem_tools utilities accessible via test_tools
- [ ] Tests verify all typing_tools utilities accessible via test_tools
- [ ] Tests verify all diagnostics_tools utilities accessible via test_tools
- [ ] Tests verify no need for additional dev-dependencies
- [ ] Tests initially fail, demonstrating missing single dependency access
- [ ] Tests follow TDD red-green-refactor cycle principles

## Status
ðŸ“‹ Ready for implementation

## Effort
4 hours

## Dependencies
None - this is the first step in the TDD cycle for single dependency access
