# Task 025: Refactor Cleanup Implementation

## Overview
Refactor cleanup implementation to ensure robust resource management (FR-7).

## Specification Reference
**FR-7:** The smoke testing utility must clean up all temporary files and directories from the filesystem upon completion, regardless of success or failure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Improve organization of cleanup implementation
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation for resource management strategy
- [ ] Optimize cleanup performance and reliability
- [ ] Enhance maintainability of cleanup logic
- [ ] Create clear patterns for resource acquisition and release
- [ ] Add automated validation for cleanup completeness
- [ ] Ensure cleanup implementation is robust against edge cases
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for cleanup failures

## Implementation Notes
- This task implements the REFACTOR phase of TDD
- Focus on code quality, maintainability, and documentation
- Preserve all existing functionality while improving structure
- Consider reliability and resource management best practices

## Refactoring Areas
1. **Code Organization**
   - Implement RAII pattern for automatic resource management
   - Separate cleanup logic into focused, reusable components
   - Improve error handling structure for cleanup operations

2. **Documentation**
   - Add detailed comments explaining resource management strategy
   - Document cleanup patterns and best practices
   - Provide examples of proper resource handling

3. **Reliability**
   - Implement retry mechanisms for transient filesystem issues
   - Add validation for complete resource cleanup
   - Use robust error handling for cleanup edge cases

4. **Maintainability**
   - Create templates for adding new cleanup operations
   - Establish clear patterns for resource lifecycle management
   - Add automated testing for cleanup completeness

- **Followed by:** Tasks for FR-8 (Conditional Smoke Test Execution)

## Success Metrics
- Cleanup code is well-organized and documented
- Resource management follows best practices and patterns
- Cleanup implementation is reliable and handles edge cases
- Performance is optimized for common cleanup scenarios
- Code review feedback is positive regarding resource management
