# Write Tests for API Stability Facade

## Description
Write failing tests to verify that test_tools API remains stable despite changes in underlying constituent crates (FR-3)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tests verify that API surface remains consistent across versions
- [ ] Tests verify that breaking changes in dependencies don't break test_tools API
- [ ] Tests verify stable facade pattern implementation
- [ ] Tests verify backward compatibility maintenance
- [ ] Tests initially fail, demonstrating missing stability mechanism
- [ ] Tests follow TDD red-green-refactor cycle principles

## Status
ðŸ“‹ Ready for implementation

## Effort
3 hours

## Dependencies
None - this is the first step in the TDD cycle for API stability
