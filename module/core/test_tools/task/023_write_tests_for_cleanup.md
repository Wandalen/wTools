# Task 023: Write Tests for Cleanup Functionality

## Overview
Write failing tests to verify SmokeModuleTest cleans up temporary files on completion/failure (FR-7).

## Specification Reference
**FR-7:** The smoke testing utility must clean up all temporary files and directories from the filesystem upon completion, regardless of success or failure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies cleanup occurs after successful smoke test
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies cleanup occurs after failed smoke test
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies all temporary files are removed
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies all temporary directories are removed
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies cleanup works with force parameter
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies proper error handling for cleanup failures
- [ ] Tests should initially fail to demonstrate TDD Red phase
- [ ] Tests should be organized in tests/cleanup_functionality.rs module

## Test Structure
```rust
#[test]
fn test_cleanup_after_successful_test() {
    // Should fail initially - implementation in task 024
    // Verify temporary files are cleaned up after successful smoke test
}

#[test]
fn test_cleanup_after_failed_test() {
    // Should fail initially - implementation in task 024
    // Verify cleanup occurs even when smoke test fails
}

#[test]
fn test_complete_file_removal() {
    // Should fail initially - implementation in task 024
    // Verify all temporary files and directories are completely removed
}

#[test]
fn test_cleanup_error_handling() {
    // Should fail initially - implementation in task 024
    // Verify proper handling when cleanup operations fail
}

#[test]
fn test_force_cleanup_option() {
    // Should fail initially - implementation in task 024
    // Verify force parameter behavior for cleanup operations
}
```
