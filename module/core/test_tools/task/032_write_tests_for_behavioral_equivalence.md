# Task 032: Write Tests for Behavioral Equivalence

## Overview
Write failing tests to verify test_tools re-exported assertions are behaviorally identical to original sources (US-2).

## Specification Reference
**US-2:** As a Crate Developer, I want to be confident that the assertions and tools re-exported by `test_tools` are identical in behavior to their original sources, so that I can refactor my code to use `test_tools` without introducing subtle bugs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies error_tools assertions behave identically via test_tools
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies collection_tools utilities behave identically via test_tools
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies diagnostics_tools assertions behave identically via test_tools
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies impls_index macros behave identically via test_tools
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies mem_tools utilities behave identically via test_tools
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies typing_tools utilities behave identically via test_tools
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies identical error messages and panic behavior
- [ ] Tests should initially fail to demonstrate TDD Red phase
- [ ] Tests should be organized in tests/behavioral_equivalence.rs module

## Test Structure
```rust
#[test]
fn test_error_tools_behavioral_equivalence() {
    // Should fail initially - implementation in task 033
    // Compare direct error_tools usage vs test_tools re-export
}

#[test]
fn test_collection_tools_behavioral_equivalence() {
    // Should fail initially - implementation in task 033
    // Compare direct collection_tools usage vs test_tools re-export
}

#[test]
fn test_diagnostics_assertions_equivalence() {
    // Should fail initially - implementation in task 033
    // Verify assertion behavior is identical between direct and re-exported access
}

#[test]
fn test_panic_and_error_message_equivalence() {
    // Should fail initially - implementation in task 033
    // Verify error messages and panic behavior are identical
}
```
