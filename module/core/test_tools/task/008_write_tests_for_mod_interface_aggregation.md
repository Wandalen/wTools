# Write Tests for mod_interface Aggregation

## Description
Write failing tests to verify that test_tools aggregates and re-exports testing utilities according to mod_interface protocol (FR-2)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tests verify proper own namespace aggregation
- [ ] Tests verify proper orphan namespace aggregation
- [ ] Tests verify proper exposed namespace aggregation
- [ ] Tests verify proper prelude namespace aggregation
- [ ] Tests verify re-export visibility from constituent crates
- [ ] Tests verify namespace isolation and propagation rules
- [ ] Tests initially fail, demonstrating missing aggregation mechanism
- [ ] Tests follow TDD red-green-refactor cycle principles

## Status
ðŸ“‹ Ready for implementation

## Effort
3 hours

## Dependencies
None - this is the first step in the TDD cycle for mod_interface aggregation
