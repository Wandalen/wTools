# Task 026: Write Tests for Conditional Smoke Test Execution

## Overview
Write failing tests to verify smoke tests execute conditionally based on WITH_SMOKE env var or CI/CD detection (FR-8).

## Specification Reference
**FR-8:** The execution of smoke tests must be conditional, triggered by the presence of the `WITH_SMOKE` environment variable or by the detection of a CI/CD environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies smoke tests execute when WITH_SMOKE env var is set
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies smoke tests execute when CI/CD environment is detected
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies smoke tests are skipped when conditions are not met
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies proper detection of CI/CD environments
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies different WITH_SMOKE values (1, local, published)
- [ ] Write failing test that verifies environment variable precedence over CI/CD detection
- [ ] Tests should initially fail to demonstrate TDD Red phase
- [ ] Tests should be organized in tests/conditional_execution.rs module

## Test Structure
```rust
#[test]
fn test_execution_with_with_smoke_env_var() {
    // Should fail initially - implementation in task 027
    // Verify smoke tests execute when WITH_SMOKE is set
}

#[test]
fn test_execution_in_cicd_environment() {
    // Should fail initially - implementation in task 027
    // Verify smoke tests execute when CI/CD environment is detected
}

#[test]
fn test_skipping_when_conditions_not_met() {
    // Should fail initially - implementation in task 027
    // Verify smoke tests are skipped in normal development environment
}

#[test]
fn test_cicd_environment_detection() {
    // Should fail initially - implementation in task 027
    // Verify proper detection of various CI/CD environment indicators
}

#[test]
fn test_with_smoke_value_variants() {
    // Should fail initially - implementation in task 027
    // Verify different WITH_SMOKE values work correctly (1, local, published)
}
```
