# Task 028: Refactor Conditional Execution Logic

## Overview
Refactor conditional execution implementation for clarity and maintainability (FR-8).

## Specification Reference
**FR-8:** The execution of smoke tests must be conditional, triggered by the presence of the `WITH_SMOKE` environment variable or by the detection of a CI/CD environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Improve organization of conditional execution logic
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation for environment detection strategy
- [ ] Optimize performance of environment checks
- [ ] Enhance maintainability of conditional logic
- [ ] Create clear separation between different execution modes
- [ ] Add validation for environment variable values
- [ ] Ensure conditional execution is extensible for future requirements
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for execution condition issues

## Implementation Notes
- This task implements the REFACTOR phase of TDD
- Focus on code quality, maintainability, and documentation
- Preserve all existing functionality while improving structure
- Consider usability and debuggability improvements

## Refactoring Areas
1. **Code Organization**
   - Organize environment detection logic into focused modules
   - Extract common patterns for conditional execution
   - Improve separation between detection and execution logic

2. **Documentation**
   - Add detailed comments explaining execution condition logic
   - Document CI/CD environment detection strategies
   - Provide examples of different execution scenarios

3. **Performance**
   - Optimize environment variable lookups
   - Cache environment detection results where appropriate
   - Use efficient condition checking patterns

4. **Maintainability**
   - Create templates for adding new execution conditions
   - Establish clear patterns for environment detection
   - Add validation for execution condition logic
