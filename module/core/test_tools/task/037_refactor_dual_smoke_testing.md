# Task 037: Refactor Dual Smoke Testing Implementation

## Overview
Refactor local/published smoke testing for improved code organization (US-3).

## Specification Reference
**US-3:** As a Crate Developer, I want to run an automated smoke test against both the local and the recently published version of my crate, so that I can quickly verify that the release was successful and the crate is usable by consumers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Improve organization of dual smoke testing implementation
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation for release validation workflow
- [ ] Optimize performance of smoke testing automation
- [ ] Enhance maintainability of dual testing logic
- [ ] Create clear separation between local and published testing modes
- [ ] Add validation for smoke testing configuration
- [ ] Ensure dual smoke testing is extensible for future enhancements
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for smoke testing issues

## Implementation Notes
- This task implements the REFACTOR phase of TDD
- Focus on code quality, maintainability, and documentation
- Preserve all existing functionality while improving structure
- Consider workflow optimization and user experience

## Refactoring Areas
1. **Code Organization**
   - Organize dual smoke testing logic into focused modules
   - Extract common patterns between local and published testing
   - Improve separation of concerns in testing workflow

2. **Documentation**
   - Add detailed comments explaining dual testing strategy
   - Document release validation workflow and best practices
   - Provide examples of effective smoke testing usage

3. **Performance**
   - Optimize execution time for dual smoke testing
   - Consider parallel execution of local and published tests
   - Use efficient resource management for testing workflow

4. **Maintainability**
   - Create templates for extending smoke testing capabilities
   - Establish clear patterns for release validation
   - Add automated validation for smoke testing configuration
