# Task 024: Implement Cleanup Functionality

## Overview
Implement SmokeModuleTest cleanup of temporary files and directories regardless of success/failure (FR-7).

## Specification Reference
**FR-7:** The smoke testing utility must clean up all temporary files and directories from the filesystem upon completion, regardless of success or failure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement automatic cleanup after successful smoke test execution
- [ ] Implement automatic cleanup after failed smoke test execution
- [ ] Ensure complete removal of all temporary files and directories
- [ ] Enhance existing clean() method with better error handling
- [ ] Add proper force parameter handling for cleanup operations
- [ ] Implement cleanup verification to ensure complete removal
- [ ] All cleanup functionality tests from task 023 must pass
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing clean() method

## Implementation Notes
- This task implements the GREEN phase of TDD - making the failing tests from task 023 pass
- Build upon existing clean() method implementation (lines 233-245 in current implementation)
- Enhance automatic cleanup integration with smoke test workflow
- Focus on improving reliability and completeness of cleanup

## Technical Approach
1. **Enhance Cleanup Method**
   - Improve existing clean() method with better error handling
   - Add validation to ensure complete directory removal
   - Implement retry mechanisms for filesystem operation failures

2. **Automatic Cleanup Integration**
   - Add cleanup calls to success and failure paths in smoke test workflow
   - Implement RAII pattern or Drop trait for automatic cleanup
   - Ensure cleanup occurs even in panic situations

3. **Cleanup Verification**
   - Add verification that temporary directories are actually removed
   - Implement checking for leftover files or directories
   - Add logging for cleanup operations and their results

## Code Areas to Enhance
- Strengthen clean() method implementation (lines 233-245)
- Add automatic cleanup integration to perform() method workflow
- Improve error handling for filesystem operations
- Add cleanup verification and logging

## Success Metrics
- All cleanup functionality tests pass
- Temporary files and directories are reliably cleaned up
- Cleanup occurs regardless of smoke test success or failure
- Filesystem resources are properly released in all scenarios
- Error handling provides clear guidance for cleanup issues

- **Previous:** Task 023 - Write Tests for Cleanup Functionality
- **Next:** Task 025 - Refactor Cleanup Implementation
- **Context:** Core implementation of specification requirement FR-7
