# Implement Conformance Testing Mechanism

## Description
Implement mechanism to execute original test suites of constituent sub-modules against re-exported APIs within test_tools using #[path] attributes (FR-1)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement #[path] attributes to include original test files from constituent crates
- [ ] Ensure error_tools test suite executes against test_tools re-exports
- [ ] Ensure collection_tools test suite executes against test_tools re-exports
- [ ] Ensure impls_index test suite executes against test_tools re-exports
- [ ] Ensure mem_tools test suite executes against test_tools re-exports
- [ ] Ensure typing_tools test suite executes against test_tools re-exports
- [ ] Ensure diagnostics_tools test suite executes against test_tools re-exports
- [ ] All tests from task 005 now pass
- [ ] Implement minimal code to satisfy the failing tests

## Status
