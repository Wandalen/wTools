# Refactor and Optimize Secrecy Implementation

## Description

Refactor and optimize the secrecy crate integration implementation to ensure production readiness, performance efficiency, and maintainable code architecture. This task focuses on code quality improvements, performance optimizations, comprehensive error handling, and advanced security features.

This includes implementing SecretInjectable trait for configuration types, adding secret validation and auditing capabilities, optimizing memory usage patterns, and ensuring the implementation follows all project design principles. This task completes the TDD cycle following tasks 018 (tests) and 019 (implementation).

## Requirements

-   All work must strictly adhere to the rules defined in the following rulebooks:
    -   `$PRO/genai/code/rules/code_design.rulebook.md`
    -   `$PRO/genai/code/rules/code_style.rulebook.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

-   All code must be refactored to follow project design patterns and principles
-   Implement SecretInjectable trait for advanced configuration integration
-   Add secret validation and strength checking capabilities
-   Implement secure configuration loading with automatic secret injection
-   Add comprehensive error handling for all secure operations
-   Performance benchmarks must show zero overhead when secure feature disabled
-   All edge cases must be handled gracefully with appropriate error messages
-   Code coverage must be maintained at existing levels or improved
-   Documentation must include security best practices and migration guide
-   All tests must pass including comprehensive integration scenarios
