# Project Plan: Fix `mem_tools` crate

### Goal
*   Ensure `module/core/mem_tools` compiles without errors or warnings.

### Progress
*   ✅ Increment 1: Initial Build and Error Analysis.

### Target Crate
*   `module/core/mem_tools`

### Relevant Context
*   Files to Include:
    *   `module/core/mem_tools/Cargo.toml`
    *   `module/core/mem_tools/src/lib.rs`
    *   `module/core/mem_tools/src/mem.rs`

### Expected Behavior Rules / Specifications (for Target Crate)
*   The crate should compile successfully with `cargo build -p mem_tools`.
*   No compilation errors or warnings should be reported.

### Target File Structure (If Applicable)
*   (No structural changes planned initially)

### Increments

*   ✅ Increment 1: Initial Build and Error Analysis.
    *   Detailed Plan Step 1: Execute `cargo build -p mem_tools` to check for compilation errors.
    *   Pre-Analysis: The `Cargo.toml` and `src/lib.rs` / `src/mem.rs` files have been reviewed. The `memcmp` FFI usage and module re-exports are noted as potential areas of interest.
    *   Crucial Design Rules: [Error Handling: Use a Centralized Approach], [Visibility: Keep Implementation Details Private]
    *   Relevant Behavior Rules: The crate should compile without errors.
    *   Verification Strategy: Execute `cargo build -p mem_tools` via `execute_command`. Analyze `execute_command` output critically for errors and warnings.
    *   Commit Message: `feat(mem_tools): Initial build check`

### Task Requirements
*   Fix any compilation errors.
*   Address any lint warnings.

### Project Requirements
*   Must use Rust 2021 edition.
*   All new APIs must be async (if applicable).
*   Lints from `[workspace.lints]` must be respected.

### Notes & Insights
*   The `Cargo.toml` includes `/rust/impl/mem` which is unusual, but `src/mem.rs` exists.
*   The `exposed` module in `src/mem.rs` re-exports `super::super::mem`, which might be problematic.
*   Initial build passed without errors or warnings.
