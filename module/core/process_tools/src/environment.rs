  /// Checks if the current execution environment is a Continuous Integration (CI) or Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline.
  ///
  /// This function looks for environment variables that are commonly set by CI/CD systems to determine if it's running
  /// within such an environment. It supports detection for a variety of popular CI/CD platforms including GitHub Actions,
  /// GitLab CI, Travis CI, CircleCI, and Jenkins.
  ///
  /// # Returns
  /// - `true` if an environment variable indicating a CI/CD environment is found.
  /// - `false` otherwise.
  ///
  /// # Examples
  ///
  /// When running in a typical development environment (locally):
  /// ```no_run
  /// use process_tools::environment;
  /// assert_eq!( environment::is_cicd(), false );
  /// ```
  ///
  /// When running in a CI/CD environment, one of the specified environment variables would be set, and:
  /// ```no_run
  /// // This example cannot be run as a test since it depends on the environment
  /// // the code is executed in. However, in a CI environment, this would return true.
  /// use process_tools::environment;
  /// assert_eq!( environment::is_cicd(), true );
  /// ```
