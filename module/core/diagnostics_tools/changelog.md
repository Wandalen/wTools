* [2025-07-26 13:33 UTC] Resolved stuck doctest by using `std::panic::catch_unwind` due to `should_panic` not working with `include_str!`.
* [2025-07-26 13:37 UTC] Refactored `trybuild` setup to be robust and idiomatic, consolidating compile-time assertion tests.
*   Applied `rustfmt` to the crate.
*   Fixed clippy warnings and missing documentation.
