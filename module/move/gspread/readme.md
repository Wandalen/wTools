## Google Sheets CLI

### Note:
When using the table view output, be aware that the formatting may not display correctly if your table contains spaces. This issue is related to the **format_tools** used for printing the table view.

**Important:** This issue only affects the visual output in the terminal and does not impact the functionality of the Google Sheets CLI itself.
