  /// # Gspread Client
  ///
  /// A struct that represents a client for interacting with Google Spreadsheets.
  ///
  /// This structure encapsulates the essential information and methods needed to
  /// authenticate and send requests to the Google Sheets API. It uses the [`Former`]
  /// procedural macro to provide builder-like functionality, allowing you to
  /// configure fields (like `token` and `endpoint`) before finalizing an instance.
  ///
  /// ## Fields
  ///
  /// - `token`  
  ///   - A `String` representing the OAuth2 access token needed to perform requests
  ///     against the Google Sheets API.  
  ///   - Typically set using the `token(&Secret)` method (see below).
  ///
  /// - `endpoint`  
  ///   - A `String` specifying the base API endpoint for Google Sheets.  
  ///   - Defaults to `"https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets"` if no value
  ///     is provided.
  /// 
  /// ## Methods
  /// 
  /// - **`spreadsheet` â†’ [`SpreadSheetValuesMethod`]**
  ///   Returns  [`SpreadSheetValuesMethod`].
  ///
  /// ## Usage
  ///
  /// An instance of `Client` can be created via its `Former` implementation. You have to
  /// set the `token` dynamically by providing a [`Secret`] to the `token( &Secret )`
  /// method, which handles OAuth2 authentication under the hood.
  /// You can use this client also for mock testing. In such case you need to provide `endpoint`
  /// using `endpoint( url )` and there is no need to set `token`.
  /// 
  /// Once the `Client` is fully constructed, you can use the `spreadsheet()` method
  /// to access various Google Sheets API operations, such as reading or updating
  /// spreadsheet cells.
