# Unilang Crate/Framework Implementation Roadmap

### Current Status (as of 2025-07-31)
The project has successfully completed its foundational phases (1-3), culminating in a critical architectural refactoring that unified the parsing pipeline and data models. The framework is now stable and robust. The next phase will focus on implementing the mandatory performance requirement for a zero-overhead static command registry, which is the cornerstone for building large-scale, high-performance utilities.

*   **Status:** All milestones are complete.

### Phase 2: Enhanced Type System, Runtime Commands & CLI Maturity üèÅ
*   **Goal:** Expand the `unilang` crate's type system, provide APIs for runtime command management, and mature CLI support.

*   **Status:** All milestones are complete.

### Phase 3: Architectural Unification & Enhancement üèÅ
*   **Goal:** Correct the project's architecture by removing legacy components, integrating `unilang_parser` as the single source of truth, and fully aligning data models with the specification.
*   **Outcome:** A stable, maintainable codebase with a unified architecture, ready for the implementation of core functional requirements.
*   **Status:** All milestones are complete.

### Phase 4: Zero-Overhead Static Command Registry
*   **Goal:** To implement the mandatory performance NFR for a zero-overhead static command system, enabling utilities with thousands of commands to start instantly.
