### 2025-06-28 - Increment 6: Implement CLI Argument Parsing and Execution
*   **Description:** Integrated the `unilang` core into a basic CLI application (`src/bin/unilang_cli.rs`). Implemented a `main` function to initialize `CommandRegistry`, register sample commands, parse command-line arguments, and use `Lexer`, `Parser`, `SemanticAnalyzer`, and `Interpreter` for execution. Handled errors by printing to `stderr` and exiting with a non-zero status code. Corrected `CommandDefinition` and `ArgumentDefinition` `former` usage. Implemented `as_integer` and `as_path` helper methods on `Value` in `src/types.rs`. Updated `CommandRoutine` signatures and return types in `src/bin/unilang_cli.rs` to align with `Result<OutputData, ErrorData>`. Corrected `Parser`, `SemanticAnalyzer`, and `Interpreter` instantiation and usage. Updated `cli_integration_test.rs` to match new `stderr` output format. Removed unused `std::path::PathBuf` import. Addressed Clippy lints (`unnecessary_wraps`, `needless_pass_by_value`, `uninlined_format_args`).
*   **Verification:** All tests passed, including `cli_integration_test.rs`, and `cargo clippy -p unilang -- -D warnings` passed.
*   [2025-07-23] fix(unilang): Resolved compilation error in `unilang_cli.rs` by correcting the parser method and argument type.
*   [2025-07-23] refactor(unilang): Adapted `SemanticAnalyzer` to use the new parser output and updated data models, including handling default arguments.
*   [2025-07-23] refactor(cli): Migrated `unilang_cli` to use the new parsing pipeline and updated command definitions with full metadata.
* [Increment 1.1 | 2025-07-26 05:54:26 UTC] Fixed `unilang::tests::inc::phase2::help_generation_test::test_cli_specific_command_help_add` by adding `use predicates::Predicate;`, explicitly capturing the lifetime with `+ '_`, and updating the expected output for argument descriptions.
* [2025-07-26] Phase 3: Reconciled data models and created comprehensive test plan.
* [2025-07-26] Phase 3: Refactored SemanticAnalyzer to use unilang_parser::GenericInstruction.
* [2025-07-26] Phase 3: Updated unilang_cli binary and core integration tests.
* [2025-07-26] Phase 3: Updated all call sites to use new data models.
* [2025-07-26] Implemented command alias resolution in CLI.
*   [2025-07-26] Added a comprehensive example (`examples/full_cli_example.rs`) demonstrating full framework usage and updated `Readme.md` to reference it.
