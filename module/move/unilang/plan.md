# Project Plan: Unilang Test File Documentation

### Goal
*   Add comprehensive documentation to all test files, including references to the Test Matrix, to ensure clarity and maintainability.

### Progress
*   ✅ Test Documentation Complete

### Target Crate
*   module/move/unilang

### Relevant Context
*   Files to Include (for AI's reference, if `read_file` is planned, primarily from Target Crate):
    *   `module/move/unilang/tests/inc/phase1/full_pipeline_test.rs`

### Expected Behavior Rules / Specifications (for Target Crate)
*   Test functions should have doc comments explaining their purpose.
*   Each test function should reference the Test Matrix row(s) it covers.

### Target File Structure (If Applicable, within Target Crate)
*   No changes to the file structure are planned.

### Increments

*   ✅ Increment 1: Document `tests/inc/phase1/full_pipeline_test.rs`
    *   Detailed Plan Step 1: Read the content of `tests/inc/phase1/full_pipeline_test.rs`.
    *   Detailed Plan Step 2: Add documentation to each test function, linking it to the corresponding Test Matrix rows from the previous plan.
    *   Pre-Analysis: The integration test file lacks documentation.
    *   Crucial Design Rules: [Testing: Plan with a Test Matrix When Writing Tests](#testing-plan-with-a-test-matrix-when-writing-tests), [Comments and Documentation](#comments-and-documentation)
    *   Relevant Behavior Rules: N/A
    *   Verification Strategy: Run `cargo test -p unilang` to ensure all tests still pass.
    *   Commit Message: "docs(unilang): Add test matrix documentation to integration tests"

### Task Requirements
*   Add documentation to test files.

### Project Requirements
*   Maintain consistency with the overall workspace codestyle.

### Notes & Insights
*   This will significantly improve the test suite's readability.
