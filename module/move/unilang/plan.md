# Project Plan: Unilang Codestyle and Documentation Review

### Goal
*   Iterate through each file of the `unilang` crate, ensuring all code adheres to the established codestyle rules and has concise, accurate documentation.

### Progress
*   ⚫ Review Not Started

### Target Crate
*   module/move/unilang

### Relevant Context
*   Files to Include (for AI's reference, if `read_file` is planned, primarily from Target Crate):
    *   All `.rs` files within `module/move/unilang/src` and `module/move/unilang/tests`.

### Expected Behavior Rules / Specifications (for Target Crate)
*   All files must pass `cargo clippy` with the workspace lint settings without warnings.
*   All public items should have clear, concise documentation.
*   Code formatting should be consistent across the entire crate.

### Target File Structure (If Applicable, within Target Crate)
*   No changes to the file structure are planned.

### Increments

*   ✅ Increment 1: Review `src/lib.rs`
    *   Detailed Plan Step 1: Read the content of `src/lib.rs`.
    *   Detailed Plan Step 2: Apply codestyle fixes, including adding documentation for all public modules.
    *   Detailed Plan Step 3: Use `mod_interface` to structure the crate's public API.
    *   Pre-Analysis: The `lib.rs` file is the entry point to the crate and should be well-documented and structured.
    *   Crucial Design Rules: [Structuring: Modules with `mod_interface`](#structuring-modules-with-mod_interface), [Comments and Documentation](#comments-and-documentation)
    *   Relevant Behavior Rules: N/A
    *   Verification Strategy: Run `cargo build -p unilang` to ensure the changes compile.
    *   Commit Message: "style(unilang): Clean up and document src/lib.rs"
*   ⚫ Increment 2: Review `src/data.rs`
    *   Commit Message: "style(unilang): Clean up and document src/data.rs"
*   ⚫ Increment 3: Review `src/error.rs`
    *   Commit Message: "style(unilang): Clean up and document src/error.rs"
*   ⚫ Increment 4: Review `src/help.rs`
    *   Commit Message: "style(unilang): Clean up and document src/help.rs"
*   ⚫ Increment 5: Review `src/interpreter.rs`
    *   Commit Message: "style(unilang): Clean up and document src/interpreter.rs"
*   ⚫ Increment 6: Review `src/parsing.rs`
    *   Commit Message: "style(unilang): Clean up and document src/parsing.rs"
*   ⚫ Increment 7: Review `src/registry.rs`
    *   Commit Message: "style(unilang): Clean up and document src/registry.rs"
*   ⚫ Increment 8: Review `src/semantic.rs`
    *   Commit Message: "style(unilang): Clean up and document src/semantic.rs"
*   ⚫ Increment 9: Review `src/ca/` directory
    *   Commit Message: "style(unilang): Clean up and document src/ca/**"
*   ⚫ Increment 10: Review `tests/` directory
    *   Commit Message: "style(unilang): Clean up and document tests/**"
*   ⚫ Increment 11: Final Verification
    *   Commit Message: "chore(unilang): Final verification of codestyle changes"

### Task Requirements
*   Systematically review every `.rs` file.
*   Apply codestyle fixes and add documentation as needed.

### Project Requirements
*   Maintain consistency with the overall workspace codestyle.

### Notes & Insights
*   This is a good opportunity to improve the overall quality and maintainability of the crate.
*   The `former` crate usage is still disabled and should be noted for future work.
