# Implement Statistical Significance Testing

## Description

**HIGH PRIORITY VIOLATION**: Usage.md requires proper statistical analysis with confidence intervals. Current benchmarks lack statistical significance testing.

**Required Implementation** (from usage.md):
```rust
// Multiple measurements with statistical analysis
let result = bench_function_n("reliable", 20, || algorithm());
let analysis = StatisticalAnalysis::analyze(&result, SignificanceLevel::Standard)?;

if analysis.is_reliable() {
    println!("Algorithm: {} ± {} ns (95% confidence)", 
             analysis.mean_time().as_nanos(),
             analysis.confidence_interval().range());
} else {
    println!("⚠️ Results not statistically reliable - need more samples");
}
```

**Prohibited Practice** (from usage.md):
```rust
// Single measurement - unreliable
let result = bench_function("unreliable", || algorithm());
println!("Algorithm takes {} ns", result.mean_time().as_nanos()); // Misleading!
```

**Current State**: No statistical significance testing or confidence interval reporting implemented.

## Requirements

-   All work must strictly adhere to the rules defined in the following rulebooks:
    -   `$PRO/genai/code/rules/code_design.rulebook.md`
    -   `$PRO/genai/code/rules/code_style.rulebook.md`
-   Must implement benchkit usage.md "Don't Ignore Statistical Significance" section
-   Related to Task 030 (CV analysis) and Task 036 (environment-specific config)
-   Must use proper sampling and significance testing

## Acceptance Criteria

-   [ ] All benchmarks use multiple measurements (minimum 20 samples)
-   [ ] Statistical significance analysis implemented for all results
-   [ ] 95% confidence intervals reported with all measurements
-   [ ] Reliability assessment before drawing conclusions
-   [ ] Insufficient data warnings when results not statistically reliable
-   [ ] Sample size recommendations provided for unreliable results
-   [ ] SignificanceLevel configuration options available
-   [ ] Statistical analysis integrated with CV checking from Task 030
