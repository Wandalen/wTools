# Verify Benchmark Execution Functionality

## Description

Test and verify that the benchkit-compliant benchmark system works end-to-end with `cargo bench` execution. This includes testing the CV analysis integration, proper directory structure, and feature flag functionality.

Areas to verify:
- `cargo bench --features benchmarks` executes successfully
- CV analysis integration functions properly in actual benchmark runs
- All benchmark files compile and run without errors
- Benchkit standard setup protocol works as expected
- Auto-documentation updates function correctly

## Requirements

-   All work must strictly adhere to the rules defined in the following rulebooks:
    -   `$PRO/genai/code/rules/code_design.rulebook.md`
    -   `$PRO/genai/code/rules/code_style.rulebook.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

-   [x] `cargo bench --features benchmarks` executes without errors
-   [x] All benchmark files in benches/ directory run successfully
-   [x] CV analysis integration produces output during benchmark runs
-   [x] No compilation errors with benchmarks feature enabled
-   [x] Benchkit compliance verified through actual execution
-   [x] Performance results are meaningful and properly formatted
-   [x] Environment-specific benchmark configuration works correctly

## Implementation Summary

**Verification Results:**
- Successfully ran comprehensive benchmark suite with `cargo bench --features benchmarks`
- Unilang benchmarks executing properly with timing data: Init: 100-426 μs, Lookup: 6-26k ns
- CV analysis integration functioning correctly with environment detection
- Framework comparison benchmarks operational (unilang vs pico-args vs clap)
- Benchmark configuration tests passing (7/7) for environment-specific settings
- Statistical significance testing integrated and working
- Performance throughput measurements accurate (50k-150k cmd/sec for unilang)

**Issues Identified:**
- Minor clippy style warnings (must_use attributes, std vs core imports)
- These do not affect benchmark functionality or results accuracy

**Status:** ✅ Completed
