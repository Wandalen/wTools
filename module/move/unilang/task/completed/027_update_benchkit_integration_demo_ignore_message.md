# Update benchkit integration demo ignore message

## Description

The benchkit integration demo test in `benchmarks/throughput_benchmark.rs` is already properly implemented using benchkit but has a generic ignore message that doesn't follow the standardized format for benchkit integration tests. The message should be updated to be consistent with other benchkit tests.

This is a minor but important consistency fix to ensure all benchmark tests follow the same ignore message pattern for clarity and maintainability.

Related to audit findings of skipped benchmark tests that need benchkit compliance.

## Requirements

-   All work must strictly adhere to the rules defined in the following rulebooks:
    -   `$PRO/genai/code/rules/code_design.rulebook.md`
    -   `$PRO/genai/code/rules/code_style.rulebook.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

-   Update ignore attribute from `"Benchkit integration demo - run explicitly"` to `"Benchkit integration - comprehensive throughput analysis"`
-   Ensure the ignore message follows the consistent format used by other benchkit tests
-   Verify the test functionality remains unchanged
-   Confirm the test still compiles and runs correctly with the updated ignore message
-   Maintain all existing benchkit functionality and statistical analysis
-   Ensure ignore message accurately describes the test's purpose
-   Follow standardized naming convention for benchkit integration tests

## Outcomes

✅ **Task Completed Successfully**

**Implementation Summary:**
- Updated ignore message from `"Benchkit integration demo - run explicitly"` to `"Benchkit integration - comprehensive throughput analysis"`
- Standardized format to match other benchkit integration tests across the codebase
- Maintained all existing benchkit functionality and statistical analysis capabilities
- Improved consistency and clarity in benchmark test naming

**Technical Details:**
- Modified ignore attribute in `benchmarks/throughput_benchmark.rs:373`
- Message now accurately describes the test's comprehensive throughput analysis purpose
- Follows established pattern: `"Benchkit integration - [descriptive analysis type]"`
- No functional changes to the underlying benchkit implementation

**Verification:**
- ✅ Test compiles correctly with updated ignore message
- ✅ All functionality preserved: `cargo nextest run --all-features` 
- ✅ Ignore message format consistent with other benchkit tests
- ✅ Message accurately describes test purpose and scope

**Benefits Achieved:**
- Improved benchmark test naming consistency
- Enhanced clarity for developers working with benchkit tests
- Better alignment with established benchkit integration patterns
- Reduced confusion about test purpose and execution requirements
