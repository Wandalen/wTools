# Fix API mismatches in benchmarks/throughput_benchmark.rs

## Description

The throughput benchmark test in `benchmarks/throughput_benchmark.rs` has critical API mismatches with the current benchkit library that prevent compilation. The benchmark attempts to use non-existent methods like `to_markdown()` on `ComparisonReport` and has return type mismatches between the declared `ComparisonReport` and actual `ComparisonAnalysisReport` types.

This task addresses the compilation errors blocking the ctest3 success by updating the benchmark to use the correct benchkit API methods and patterns as defined in the benchkit documentation and source code.

## Requirements

-   All work must strictly adhere to the rules defined in the following rulebooks:
    -   `$PRO/genai/code/rules/code_design.rulebook.md` 
    -   `$PRO/genai/code/rules/code_style.rulebook.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

-   The `run_framework_comparison_benchkit()` function returns the correct `ComparisonReport` type
-   Replace all calls to non-existent `to_markdown()` method with proper benchkit reporting methods like `fastest()`, `slowest()`, and `sorted_by_performance()`
-   The `test_benchkit_integration_demo()` function compiles and runs without errors
-   All benchmark tests maintain proper feature gating with `#[cfg(feature = "benchmarks")]`
-   Benchmarks continue to provide meaningful performance comparison results
-   The file compiles successfully when benchmarks feature is enabled
-   All existing benchmark functionality is preserved using correct benchkit APIs
