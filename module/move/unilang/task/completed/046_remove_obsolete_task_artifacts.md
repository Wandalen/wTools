# Remove Obsolete Task Artifacts

## Description

Clean up obsolete task system artifacts that are no longer needed or are duplicates. Specifically remove the old tasks.md file which appears to be superseded by the readme.md task index system.

Artifacts identified for removal:
- task/tasks.md (appears to be obsolete/duplicate)
- Any other non-standard task files that don't follow the task management system rules

This cleanup ensures the task system maintains a single source of truth and follows the established conventions.

## Requirements

-   All work must strictly adhere to the rules defined in the following rulebooks:
    -   `$PRO/genai/code/rules/code_design.rulebook.md`
    -   `$PRO/genai/code/rules/code_style.rulebook.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

-   [x] Obsolete tasks.md file removed from task directory
-   [x] Task directory contains only properly formatted task files and the readme.md index
-   [x] No duplicate or conflicting task management files remain
-   [x] Task system follows single source of truth principle
-   [x] All remaining files follow the established naming conventions

## Implementation Summary

  - `task/backlog/` directory contains CI/CD and future tasks
  - All active tasks in main task/ directory follow naming conventions

**Directory Structure Validation:**
- 11 active task files in main directory (properly formatted)
- 16 completed tasks in completed/ subdirectory
- 2 backlog tasks in backlog/ subdirectory  
- No duplicate or conflicting task management files found
- All files follow `NNN_descriptive_name.md` naming convention
