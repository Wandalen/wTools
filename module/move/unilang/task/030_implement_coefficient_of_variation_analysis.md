# Implement Coefficient of Variation Analysis

## Description

**CRITICAL VIOLATION**: Usage.md states CV serves as "key reliability indicator" for benchmark quality, yet zero instances of CV analysis exist in any benchmark file.

**Required CV Standards** (from usage.md):
- CV < 5%: Excellent reliability (ready for production decisions)
- CV 5-10%: Good, acceptable for most use cases
- CV 10-15%: Moderate, consider improvements
- CV > 15%: Poor/Unreliable, must fix before using results

**Current State**: No CV checking, analysis, or improvement techniques implemented.

**Required Implementation**:
```rust
let result = bench_function_n("reliable", 20, || algorithm());
let cv_percent = result.coefficient_of_variation() * 100.0;

if cv_percent > 10.0 {
    println!("⚠️ High CV ({:.1}%) - results unreliable", cv_percent);
    // Apply CV improvement techniques from usage.md
} else {
    println!("✅ CV: {:.1}% - Reliable", cv_percent);
}
```

## Requirements

-   All work must strictly adhere to the rules defined in the following rulebooks:
    -   `$PRO/genai/code/rules/code_design.rulebook.md`
    -   `$PRO/genai/code/rules/code_style.rulebook.md`
-   Must implement benchkit usage.md "Coefficient of Variation (CV) Standards" section
-   Must include CV improvement techniques: thread pool warmup, CPU stabilization, cache warmup
-   Related to Task 029 (setup protocol) and Task 031 (measurement context)

## Acceptance Criteria

-   [ ] All benchmarks report CV values with results
-   [ ] CV thresholds implemented according to usage.md standards
-   [ ] High CV warnings trigger improvement suggestions
-   [ ] Thread pool stabilization implemented for parallel operations
-   [ ] CPU frequency stabilization delays implemented
-   [ ] Cache warmup cycles implemented for memory-intensive operations
-   [ ] Statistical significance testing with confidence intervals
-   [ ] Environment-specific CV targets (development/CI/production)
