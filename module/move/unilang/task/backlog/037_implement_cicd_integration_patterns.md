# Implement CI/CD Integration Patterns

## Description

**MODERATE PRIORITY VIOLATION**: Usage.md provides specific GitHub Actions patterns that should be followed. No evidence of recommended CI/CD integration patterns.

**Required GitHub Actions Pattern** (from usage.md):
```yaml
name: Performance Benchmarks

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  benchmarks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup Rust
      uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
      with:
        toolchain: stable
    
    # Key insight: Use standard cargo bench
    - name: Run benchmarks and update documentation
      run: cargo bench
    
    # Documentation updates automatically happen during cargo bench
    - name: Commit updated documentation
      run: |
        git config --local user.email "action@github.com"
        git config --local user.name "GitHub Action"
        git add README.md PERFORMANCE.md benches/readme.md
        git commit -m "docs: Update performance benchmarks" || exit 0
        git push
```

## Requirements

-   All work must strictly adhere to the rules defined in the following rulebooks:
    -   `$PRO/genai/code/rules/code_design.rulebook.md`
    -   `$PRO/genai/code/rules/code_style.rulebook.md`
-   Must follow benchkit usage.md "GitHub Actions Integration" section
-   Related to Task 034 (cargo bench workflow) and Task 038 (regression detection)
-   Must use standard Rust tooling and keep documentation automatically updated

## Acceptance Criteria

-   [ ] GitHub Actions workflow file created for performance benchmarks
-   [ ] Workflow triggers on push to main and pull requests
-   [ ] Uses standard `cargo bench` command
-   [ ] Automatic documentation updates during CI
-   [ ] Automatic git commit of updated documentation
-   [ ] Multi-environment testing support
-   [ ] Benchmark execution integrated with existing CI pipeline
-   [ ] Performance regression detection in CI (links to Task 038)
