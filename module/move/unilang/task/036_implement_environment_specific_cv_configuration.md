# Implement Environment-Specific CV Configuration

## Description

**HIGH PRIORITY VIOLATION**: Usage.md requires different CV targets for different environments. No environment-specific benchmark configuration exists.

**Required Environment Configurations** (from usage.md):

| Environment | Target CV | Sample Count | Primary Focus |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Development** | < 15% | 10-20 samples | Quick feedback cycles |
| **CI/CD** | < 10% | 20-30 samples | Reliable regression detection |
| **Production Analysis** | < 5% | 50+ samples | Decision-grade reliability |

**Required Implementation**:
```rust
let config = match std::env::var("BENCHMARK_ENV").as_deref() {
    Ok("production") => BenchmarkConfig {
        regression_threshold: 0.05,  // Strict: 5%
        min_sample_size: 50,
        cv_tolerance: 0.05,
    },
    Ok("staging") => BenchmarkConfig {
        regression_threshold: 0.10,  // Moderate: 10%
        min_sample_size: 20,
        cv_tolerance: 0.10,
    },
    _ => BenchmarkConfig {
        regression_threshold: 0.15,  // Lenient: 15%
        min_sample_size: 10,
        cv_tolerance: 0.15,
    },
};
```

## Requirements

-   All work must strictly adhere to the rules defined in the following rulebooks:
    -   `$PRO/genai/code/rules/code_design.rulebook.md`
    -   `$PRO/genai/code/rules/code_style.rulebook.md`
-   Must implement benchkit usage.md "Environment-Specific CV Guidelines" section
-   Related to Task 030 (CV analysis) and Task 037 (CI/CD integration)
-   Must support development, CI/CD, and production analysis environments
