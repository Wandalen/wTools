# Add Context-Rich Benchmark Documentation

## Description

**MODERATE PRIORITY VIOLATION**: Usage.md requires context and interpretation, not just raw numbers. Current documentation lacks comprehensive context.

**Prohibited Raw Numbers** (from usage.md):
```
## Cache Optimization Performance Results
- algorithm_a: 1.2ms
- algorithm_b: 1.8ms  
- algorithm_c: 0.9ms
```

**Required Context-Rich Format** (from usage.md):
```
## Cache Optimization Performance Results

// What is measured: Cache-friendly optimization algorithms on dataset of 50K records
// How to measure: cargo bench --bench cache_optimizations --features large_datasets

Performance comparison after implementing cache-friendly optimizations:

| Algorithm | Before | After | Improvement | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|-------------|---------|
| algorithm_a | 1.4ms | 1.2ms | 15% faster | ✅ Optimized |
| algorithm_b | 1.8ms | 1.8ms | No change | ⚠️ Needs work |
| algorithm_c | 1.2ms | 0.9ms | 25% faster | ✅ Production ready |

**Key Finding**: Cache optimizations provide significant benefits for algorithms A and C.
**Recommendation**: Implement similar patterns in algorithm B for consistency.
**Environment**: 16GB RAM, SSD storage, typical production load
```

## Requirements

-   All work must strictly adhere to the rules defined in the following rulebooks:
    -   `$PRO/genai/code/rules/code_design.rulebook.md`
    -   `$PRO/genai/code/rules/code_style.rulebook.md`
-   Must follow benchkit usage.md "Write Context-Rich Reports" section
-   Related to Task 031 (measurement context) and Task 043 (before/after analysis)
-   Must include interpretation and actionable insights
