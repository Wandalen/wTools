## Part I: Public Contract (Mandatory Requirements)
*This part of the specification defines the stable, externally visible promises of the `unilang` framework. All requirements in this section are mandatory.*

### 1. Vision & Scope

#### 1.1. Core Vision: Define Once, Use Everywhere
The `unilang` framework **must** provide a unified way to define command-line utility interfaces once, automatically enabling consistent interaction across multiple modalities such as CLI, TUI, GUI, and Web APIs. The core goals are:

*   **Consistency:** A single, declarative way to define commands and their arguments, regardless of how they are presented or invoked.
*   **Discoverability:** Easy ways for users and systems to find available commands and understand their usage through an automated help system.
*   **Flexibility:** Support for various methods of command definition (compile-time, run-time, declarative, procedural).
*   **Extensibility:** Provide structures that enable an integrator to build an extensible system.
*   **Efficiency:** Support for efficient parsing and zero-overhead command dispatch for statically defined commands.
*   **Interoperability:** A standardized representation for commands, enabling integration with other tools or web services.
*   **Robustness:** Clear, user-friendly error handling and a rich argument validation system.
*   **Security:** Provide a framework for defining and enforcing secure command execution.

#### 1.2. In Scope: The Multi-Crate Framework
The Unilang specification governs a suite of related crates that work together to provide the full framework functionality. The primary crates **must** be:

*   **`unilang`**: The core framework crate that orchestrates parsing, semantic analysis, execution, and modality management. It provides the primary public API for integrators.
*   **`unilang_parser`**: A dedicated, low-level crate responsible for the lexical and syntactic analysis of the `unilang` command language.
*   **`unilang_meta`**: A companion crate providing procedural macros (e.g., `#[command]`) to simplify compile-time command definition.

#### 1.3. Out of Scope
The `unilang` framework is responsible for the command interface and execution pipeline, not the business logic itself. The following are explicitly out of scope for the framework:

*   **Business Logic Implementation:** The framework will invoke command `Routines`, but the implementation of the business logic within those routines is the responsibility of the `Integrator`.
*   **Transactional Guarantees:** The framework does not provide transactional guarantees for sequences of commands. A failure in one command in a sequence does not automatically roll back the effects of previously executed commands.
*   **Inter-Command State Management:** The framework provides an `ExecutionContext` for passing data to commands, but it does not manage complex state between command invocations. State management is the responsibility of the `Integrator`.
*   **User Interface (UI) Rendering:** The framework provides the data and structure for different modalities (CLI, TUI, GUI) but does not render the UI itself. UI rendering is the responsibility of modality-specific crates or the `Integrator`'s application.

### 2. System Actors

An Actor is any entity that plays a distinct role and participates in an interaction within the system's architecture.

#### 2.1. Human Actors
*   **`Integrator (Developer)`**: The primary human actor who uses the `unilang` framework crates (`unilang`, `unilang_parser`, `unilang_meta`) to build a `utility1` application. Their responsibilities include defining commands, implementing routines, and configuring the framework.
*   **`End User`**: A human actor who interacts with the compiled `utility1` application through one of its exposed `Modalities` (e.g., by typing commands into a CLI).

#### 2.2. External System Actors
*   **`Operating System`**: A system actor that provides the execution environment for `utility1`, including the CLI shell, file system, and environment variables.
*   **`External Service`**: Any external system (e.g., a database, a web API) that a command `Routine` might interact with. The `unilang` framework does not interact with these services directly, but it facilitates the execution of routines that do.

#### 2.3. Internal System Actors
*   **`Build Script (build.rs)`**: A critical internal actor responsible for compile-time operations. Its primary role is to process static command definitions (from code or manifests) and generate the Perfect Hash Function (PHF) map, enabling the zero-overhead static command registry.
*   **`Command Registry`**: An internal actor that serves as the runtime database for all command definitions. It manages both the static (PHF) and dynamic (HashMap) command sets and provides the lookup service used by the `Semantic Analyzer`.
*   **`Parser (unilang_parser)`**: An internal actor that performs lexical and syntactic analysis on a raw input string, converting it into a structured `GenericInstruction` without any knowledge of command definitions.
*   **`Semantic Analyzer`**: An internal actor that validates a `GenericInstruction` against the `Command Registry` to produce a `VerifiedCommand` that is guaranteed to be executable.
*   **`Interpreter`**: An internal actor that takes a `VerifiedCommand` and invokes its corresponding `Routine`, managing the execution context and handling results.

### 3. Ubiquitous Language (Vocabulary)

*   **`unilang`**: This specification and the core framework crate.
*   **`utility1`**: A generic placeholder for the primary application that implements `unilang`.
*   **`Command Registry`**: The runtime data structure that holds all known `CommandDefinition`s and their associated `Routine`s. It supports both static (compile-time) and dynamic (run-time) registration.
*   **`CommandDefinition`**: The canonical metadata for a command, defining its name, arguments, aliases, and behavior.
*   **`ArgumentDefinition`**: The canonical metadata for a command's argument, defining its name, `Kind`, and validation rules.
*   **`Routine`**: The executable code (a Rust closure or function) associated with a command.
*   **`Modality`**: A specific way of interacting with `utility1` (e.g., CLI, REPL, Web API).
*   **`GenericInstruction`**: The structured, syntax-aware output of the `unilang_parser`, representing a parsed but unvalidated command invocation.
*   **`VerifiedCommand`**: The output of the `Semantic Analyzer`; a command that has been validated against the `Command Registry` and is guaranteed to be executable.
*   **`Pipeline`**: A high-level API object that orchestrates the full processing flow from string input to execution result.
*   **`Kind`**: The data type of an argument (e.g., `Integer`, `String`, `List`, `Map`).

### 4. Core Functional Requirements

This section lists the specific, testable functions the `unilang` framework **must** provide.

#### 4.1. Command & Registry Management
*   **FR-REG-1 (Static Registration):** The framework **must** provide a mechanism, via a `build.rs` script, to register commands at compile-time from a manifest file (e.g., `unilang.commands.yaml`).
*   **FR-REG-2 (Dynamic Registration):** The framework **must** expose a public API (`CommandRegistry::command_add_runtime`) for registering new commands and their routines at runtime.
*   **FR-REG-3 (Declarative Loading):** The framework **must** provide functions (`load_from_yaml_str`, `load_from_json_str`) to load `CommandDefinition`s from structured text at runtime.
*   **FR-REG-4 (Namespace Support):** The framework **must** support hierarchical command organization through dot-separated namespaces (e.g., `.math.add`).
*   **FR-REG-5 (Alias Resolution):** The framework **must** support command aliases. When an alias is invoked, the framework **must** execute the corresponding canonical command.

#### 4.2. Argument Parsing & Type System
*   **FR-ARG-1 (Type Support):** The framework **must** support parsing and type-checking for the following `Kind`s: `String`, `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean`, `Path`, `File`, `Directory`, `Enum`, `Url`, `DateTime`, `Pattern`, `List`, `Map`, `JsonString`, and `Object`.
*   **FR-ARG-2 (Positional Binding):** The framework **must** correctly bind positional arguments from a `GenericInstruction` to the corresponding `ArgumentDefinition`s in the order they are defined.
*   **FR-ARG-3 (Named Binding):** The framework **must** correctly bind named arguments (`name::value`) from a `GenericInstruction` to the corresponding `ArgumentDefinition`, regardless of order.
*   **FR-ARG-4 (Alias Binding):** The framework **must** correctly bind named arguments specified via an alias to the correct `ArgumentDefinition`.
*   **FR-ARG-5 (Default Values):** If an optional argument with a default value is not provided, the framework **must** use the default value during semantic analysis.
*   **FR-ARG-6 (Validation Rule Enforcement):** The `Semantic Analyzer` **must** enforce all `ValidationRule`s (`Min`, `Max`, `MinLength`, `MaxLength`, `Pattern`, `MinItems`) defined for an argument. If a rule is violated, a `UNILANG_VALIDATION_RULE_FAILED` error **must** be returned.

#### 4.3. Command Execution Pipeline
*   **FR-PIPE-1 (Pipeline Orchestration):** The `Pipeline` API **must** correctly orchestrate the full sequence: Parsing -> Semantic Analysis -> Interpretation.
*   **FR-PIPE-2 (Batch Processing):** The `Pipeline::process_batch` method **must** execute a list of commands independently, collecting results for each and not stopping on individual failures.
*   **FR-PIPE-3 (Sequence Processing):** The `Pipeline::process_sequence` method **must** execute a list of commands in order and **must** terminate immediately upon the first command failure.

#### 4.4. Help & Discovery System
*   **FR-HELP-1 (Command List):** The `HelpGenerator` **must** be able to produce a formatted list of all registered commands, including their names, namespaces, and hints.
*   **FR-HELP-2 (Detailed Command Help):** The `HelpGenerator` **must** be able to produce detailed, formatted help for a specific command, including its description, arguments (with types, defaults, and validation rules), aliases, and examples.
*   **FR-HELP-3 (Help Operator):** The parser **must** recognize the `?` operator. When present, the `Semantic Analyzer` **must** return a `HELP_REQUESTED` error containing the detailed help text for the specified command, bypassing all argument validation.

#### 4.5. Modality Support
*   **FR-REPL-1 (REPL Support):** The framework's core components (`Pipeline`, `Parser`, `SemanticAnalyzer`, `Interpreter`) **must** be structured to support a REPL-style execution loop. They **must** be reusable for multiple, sequential command executions within a single process lifetime.
*   **FR-INTERACTIVE-1 (Interactive Argument Prompting):** When a mandatory argument with the `interactive: true` attribute is not provided, the `Semantic Analyzer` **must** return a distinct, catchable error (`UNILANG_ARGUMENT_INTERACTIVE_REQUIRED`). This allows the calling modality to intercept the error and prompt the user for input.
*   **FR-MOD-WASM-REPL (WebAssembly REPL Modality):** The framework **must** support a web-based REPL modality that can operate entirely on the client-side without a backend server. This requires the core `unilang` library to be fully compilable to the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.

### 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR-PERF-1 (Startup Time):** For a utility with 1,000,000+ statically compiled commands, the framework **must** introduce zero runtime overhead for command registration. Application startup time **must not** be proportional to the number of static commands. This **must** be achieved via compile-time generation of a Perfect Hash Function (PHF).
*   **NFR-PERF-2 (Lookup Latency):** The p99 latency for resolving a command `FullName` and its arguments **must** be less than 100 nanoseconds for any registry size.
*   **NFR-PERF-3 (Throughput):** The framework **must** be capable of processing over 5,000,000 simple command lookups per second on a standard developer machine.
*   **NFR-SEC-1 (Sensitive Data):** Argument values marked as `sensitive: true` **must not** be displayed in logs or user interfaces unless explicitly required by a secure context.
*   **NFR-ROBUST-1 (Error Reporting):** All user-facing errors **must** be returned as a structured `ErrorData` object and provide clear, actionable messages. Internal panics **must** be caught and converted to a user-friendly `UNILANG_INTERNAL_ERROR`.
*   **NFR-PLATFORM-1 (WASM Compatibility):** The core logic of the `unilang` and `unilang_parser` crates **must** be platform-agnostic and fully compatible with the WebAssembly (`wasm32-unknown-unknown`) target. This implies that the core crates **must not** depend on libraries or functionalities that are tied to a specific native OS (e.g., native threading, direct file system access that cannot be abstracted) unless those features are conditionally compiled and disabled for the WASM target.
*   **NFR-MODULARITY-1 (Granular Features):** All non-essential framework functionality **must** be gated behind Cargo features. This includes support for complex types (`Url`, `DateTime`), declarative loading (`serde_yaml`, `serde_json`), and other features that introduce dependencies.
*   **NFR-MODULARITY-2 (Lightweight Core):** When compiled with `default-features = false`, the `unilang` framework **must** have a minimal dependency footprint, comparable in lightness (dependencies, compile time) to the `pico-args` crate. The core functionality **must** be contained within the `enabled` feature.

### 6. CLI Modality: Language Syntax & Processing

The `unilang_parser` crate **must** be the reference implementation for this section. The parser **must** adhere to the following rules in order:

*   **Rule 1 (Tokenization):** Whitespace separates tokens. Quoted strings (`'...'` or `"..."`) are treated as a single token.
*   **Rule 2 (Command Path):** The command path is the first token. It **must** be a dot-separated identifier (e.g., `.system.echo`). A leading dot is optional.
*   **Rule 3 (Arguments):** All subsequent tokens are arguments.
    *   **Named Arguments:** **Must** use the `name::value` syntax.
    *   **Positional Arguments:** Any token that is not a named argument is a positional argument.
*   **Rule 4 (Help Operator):** The `?` operator, if present, **must** be the final token and triggers the help system.
*   **Rule 5 (Special Case - Discovery):** A standalone dot (`.`) **must** be interpreted as a request to list all available commands.

### 7. API Reference: Core Data Structures

The public API **must** include the following data structures with the specified fields. (See `src/data.rs` for the source of truth).

*   `CommandDefinition`: Defines a command's metadata.
*   `ArgumentDefinition`: Defines an argument's metadata.
*   `ArgumentAttributes`: Defines behavioral flags for an argument.
*   `Kind`: Defines the data type of an argument.
*   `ValidationRule`: Defines a validation constraint for an argument.
*   `OutputData`: Standardized structure for successful command output.
*   `ErrorData`: Standardized structure for command failure information.

### 8. Cross-Cutting Concerns (Error Handling, Security, Verbosity)

*   **Error Handling:** All recoverable errors **must** be propagated as `unilang::Error`, which wraps an `ErrorData` struct containing a machine-readable `code` and a human-readable `message`.
*   **Security:** The framework **must** provide a `permissions` field in `CommandDefinition` for integrators to implement role-based access control. The `sensitive` attribute on arguments **must** be respected.
*   **Verbosity:** The framework **must** support at least three verbosity levels (`quiet`, `normal`, `debug`) configurable via environment variable (`UNILANG_VERBOSITY`) or programmatically.

### 9. Feature Flags & Modularity

The framework **must** be highly modular, allowing integrators to select only the features they need to minimize binary size and compile times.

#### 9.1. The `enabled` Feature
Every crate in the `unilang` ecosystem (`unilang`, `unilang_parser`, `unilang_meta`) **must** expose an `enabled` feature. This feature **must** be part of the `default` feature set. Disabling the `enabled` feature (`--no-default-features`) **must** effectively remove all of the crate's code and dependencies from the compilation, allowing it to be "turned off" even when included as a non-optional dependency in a workspace.

#### 9.2. Feature Sets
The following feature flags **must** be available to integrators:

| Feature | Description | Dependencies Enabled | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `default` | Enables the standard, full-featured framework experience. | `enabled`, `full` | Yes |
| `enabled` | The master switch that enables the core framework logic. Disabling this removes the crate entirely. | (Core logic) | Yes |
| `full` | A convenience feature that enables all optional functionality below. | All optional features | Yes |
| `declarative_loading` | Enables loading `CommandDefinition`s from YAML and JSON strings. | `serde`, `serde_yaml`, `serde_json` | No |
| `on_unknown_suggest` | Enables suggestions for mistyped commands (e.g., "did you mean...?"). | `textdistance` | No |
| `chrono_types` | Enables support for the `Kind::DateTime` argument type. | `chrono` | No |
| `url_types` | Enables support for the `Kind::Url` argument type. | `url` | No |
| `regex_types` | Enables support for the `Kind::Pattern` argument type and `ValidationRule::Pattern`. | `regex` | No |

---
## Part II: Internal Design (Design Recommendations)
*This part of the specification describes the recommended internal architecture and implementation strategies. These are best-practice starting points, and the development team has the flexibility to modify them as needed.*

### 10. Architectural Mandates & Design Principles

It is recommended that the `unilang` ecosystem adhere to the following principles:

*   **Parser Independence:** The `unilang` core crate **should** delegate all command string parsing to the `unilang_parser` crate.
*   **Zero-Overhead Static Registry:** To meet `NFR-PERF-1`, it is **strongly recommended** that the `CommandRegistry` be implemented using a hybrid model:
    *   A **Perfect Hash Function (PHF)** map, generated at compile-time in `build.rs`, for all statically known commands.
    *   A standard `HashMap` for commands registered dynamically at runtime.
    *   Lookups **should** check the static PHF first before falling back to the dynamic map.
*   **`enabled` Feature Gate Mandate:** All framework crates **must** implement the `enabled` feature gate pattern. The entire crate's functionality, including its modules and dependencies, **should** be conditionally compiled using `#[cfg(feature = "enabled")]`. This is a critical mechanism for managing complex feature sets and dependencies within a Cargo workspace, allowing a crate to be effectively disabled even when it is listed as a non-optional dependency.

### 12. Crate-Specific Responsibilities

*   **`unilang` (Core Framework):** Recommended to be the central orchestrator, implementing the `CommandRegistry`, `SemanticAnalyzer`, `Interpreter`, `Pipeline`, and all core data structures.
*   **`unilang_parser` (Parser):** Recommended to be the dedicated lexical and syntactic analyzer. It should be stateless and have no knowledge of command definitions.
*   **`unilang_meta` (Macros):** Recommended to provide procedural macros for a simplified, compile-time developer experience.

---
## Part III: Project & Process Governance
*This part of the specification defines the project's goals, scope, and the rules governing its development process.*

### 13. Project Goals & Success Metrics
*   **Primary Goal:** To create a stable, performant, and ergonomic framework for building multi-modal command-line utilities in Rust that allows developers to define a command interface once and deploy it everywhere with zero-overhead for static commands.
*   **Success Metric 1 (Performance):** The framework **must** meet all performance NFRs defined in Section 5, verified by the project's benchmark suite.
*   **Success Metric 2 (Adoption):** The framework is considered successful if it is used to build at least three distinct `utility1` applications with different modalities within 12 months of the v1.0 release.

### 14. Deliverables

Upon completion, the project will deliver the following artifacts:

1.  The published `unilang` Rust crate on crates.io.
2.  The published `unilang_parser` Rust crate on crates.io.
3.  The published `unilang_meta` Rust crate on crates.io.
4.  A compiled WebAssembly (`.wasm`) package and associated JavaScript bindings for the core framework, enabling client-side execution.
5.  Full access to the source code repository, including all examples and benchmarks.
6.  Generated API documentation hosted on docs.rs for all public crates.

### 15. Open Questions
1.  **Custom Type Registration:** What is the API and process for an `Integrator` to define a new custom `Kind` and register its associated parsing and validation logic with the framework?
2.  **Plugin System:** What would a formal plugin system look like, allowing third-party crates to provide `unilang` commands to a host application?

### 16. Core Principles of Development

#### 16.1. Single Source of Truth
The project's Git repository **must** be the absolute single source of truth for all project-related information. This includes specifications, documentation, source code, configuration files, and architectural diagrams.

#### 16.2. Documentation-First Development
All changes to the system's functionality or architecture **must** be documented in the relevant specification files *before* implementation begins.

#### 16.3. Review-Driven Change Control
All modifications to the repository, without exception, **must** go through a formal Pull Request review.

#### 16.4. Radical Transparency and Auditability
The development process **must** be fully transparent and auditable. All significant decisions and discussions **must** be captured in writing within the relevant Pull Request or a linked issue tracker. The repository's history should provide a clear, chronological narrative of the project's evolution.

#### 16.5. File Naming Conventions
All file names within the project repository **must** use lowercase `snake_case`.

---
### Appendix: Addendum
*This appendix is intended for developer use during implementation. It captures as-built details and serves as a living document during the development cycle.*

#### Purpose
This document is intended to be completed by the **Developer** during the implementation phase. It is used to capture the final, as-built details of the **Internal Design**, especially where the implementation differs from the initial `Design Recommendations` in `spec.md`.

#### Instructions for the Developer
As you build the system, please use this document to log your key implementation decisions, the final data models, environment variables, and other details. This creates a crucial record for future maintenance, debugging, and onboarding.

| ❌ | **FR-REG-4:** The framework must support hierarchical command organization through dot-separated namespaces (e.g., `.math.add`). | |
| ❌ | **FR-REG-5:** The framework must support command aliases. When an alias is invoked, the framework must execute the corresponding canonical command. | |
| ❌ | **FR-ARG-1:** The framework must support parsing and type-checking for the following `Kind`s: `String`, `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean`, `Path`, `File`, `Directory`, `Enum`, `Url`, `DateTime`, `Pattern`, `List`, `Map`, `JsonString`, and `Object`. | |
| ❌ | **FR-ARG-2:** The framework must correctly bind positional arguments from a `GenericInstruction` to the corresponding `ArgumentDefinition`s in the order they are defined. | |
| ❌ | **FR-ARG-3:** The framework must correctly bind named arguments (`name::value`) from a `GenericInstruction` to the corresponding `ArgumentDefinition`, regardless of order. | |
| ❌ | **FR-ARG-4:** The framework must correctly bind named arguments specified via an alias to the correct `ArgumentDefinition`. | |
| ❌ | **FR-ARG-5:** If an optional argument with a default value is not provided, the framework must use the default value during semantic analysis. | |
| ❌ | **FR-ARG-6:** The `Semantic Analyzer` must enforce all `ValidationRule`s (`Min`, `Max`, `MinLength`, `MaxLength`, `Pattern`, `MinItems`) defined for an argument. If a rule is violated, a `UNILANG_VALIDATION_RULE_FAILED` error must be returned. | |
| ❌ | **FR-PIPE-1:** The `Pipeline` API must correctly orchestrate the full sequence: Parsing -> Semantic Analysis -> Interpretation. | |
| ❌ | **FR-PIPE-2:** The `Pipeline::process_batch` method must execute a list of commands independently, collecting results for each and not stopping on individual failures. | |
| ❌ | **FR-PIPE-3:** The `Pipeline::process_sequence` method must execute a list of commands in order and must terminate immediately upon the first command failure. | |
| ❌ | **FR-HELP-1:** The `HelpGenerator` must be able to produce a formatted list of all registered commands, including their names, namespaces, and hints. | |
| ❌ | **FR-HELP-2:** The `HelpGenerator` must be able to produce detailed, formatted help for a specific command, including its description, arguments (with types, defaults, and validation rules), aliases, and examples. | |
| ❌ | **FR-HELP-3:** The parser must recognize the `?` operator. When present, the `Semantic Analyzer` must return a `HELP_REQUESTED` error containing the detailed help text for the specified command, bypassing all argument validation. | |
| ❌ | **FR-REPL-1:** The framework's core components (`Pipeline`, `Parser`, `SemanticAnalyzer`, `Interpreter`) must be structured to support a REPL-style execution loop. They must be reusable for multiple, sequential command executions within a single process lifetime. | |
| ❌ | **FR-INTERACTIVE-1:** When a mandatory argument with the `interactive: true` attribute is not provided, the `Semantic Analyzer` must return a distinct, catchable error (`UNILANG_ARGUMENT_INTERACTIVE_REQUIRED`). This allows the calling modality to intercept the error and prompt the user for input. | |
| ❌ | **FR-MOD-WASM-REPL:** The framework must support a web-based REPL modality that can operate entirely on the client-side without a backend server. This requires the core `unilang` library to be fully compilable to the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target. | |

#### Finalized Internal Design Decisions
*A space for the developer to document key implementation choices for the system's internal design, especially where they differ from the initial recommendations in `spec.md`.*

-   [Decision 1: Reason...]
-   [Decision 2: Reason...]

#### Finalized Internal Data Models
*The definitive, as-built schema for all databases, data structures, and objects used internally by the system.*

-   [Model 1: Schema and notes...]
-   [Model 2: Schema and notes...]

#### Environment Variables
*List all environment variables required to run the application. Include the variable name, a brief description of its purpose, and an example value (use placeholders for secrets).*

| Variable | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `UNILANG_VERBOSITY` | Sets the logging verbosity (0=quiet, 1=normal, 2=debug). | `2` |
| `UNILANG_STATIC_COMMANDS_PATH` | Overrides the default path to the compile-time command manifest. | `config/commands.yaml` |

#### Finalized Library & Tool Versions
*List the critical libraries, frameworks, or tools used and their exact locked versions (e.g., from `Cargo.lock`).*

-   `rustc`: `1.78.0`
-   `phf`: `0.11`
-   `serde`: `1.0`
-   `serde_yaml`: `0.9`

#### Deployment Checklist
*A step-by-step guide for deploying the application from scratch. This is not applicable for a library, but would be used by an `Integrator`.*

1.  Set up the `.env` file using the template above.
2.  Run `cargo build --release`.
3.  Place the compiled binary in `/usr/local/bin`.
