## Missed Opportunities Identified

### 1. Historical Performance Tracking 🔍

**Gap**: Unilang benchmarks don't maintain performance history across runs

**Opportunity**: Benchkit could provide:
- Automatic baseline management
- Performance trend analysis over time  
- Regression detection across commits
- Performance budget enforcement

**Implementation**: Add `historical_tracking` feature with JSON storage

### 2. Compile-Time Performance Metrics 🔍

**Gap**: Original unilang tracked compilation times, benchkit doesn't

**Opportunity**: Add build-time measurement capabilities:
- Compilation duration tracking
- Binary size impact analysis
- Dependency compilation cost
- Feature flag compilation impact

**Implementation**: Add `build_metrics` feature with cargo integration

### 3. Interactive Performance Exploration 🔍

**Gap**: Both implementations require recompilation for different parameters

**Opportunity**: Add runtime configuration:
- Command-line parameter sweeps
- Interactive scaling exploration
- Dynamic framework selection
- Real-time visualization

**Implementation**: Add `interactive` feature with CLI interface

### 4. Advanced Statistical Analysis 🔍

**Gap**: While benchkit provides basic statistics, advanced analysis is missing

**Opportunity**: Enhanced statistical capabilities:
- Bayesian performance comparison
- Change point detection  
- Performance distribution modeling
- Causal analysis of performance factors

**Implementation**: Expand `statistical_analysis` feature

### 5. Integration with Profiling Tools 🔍

**Gap**: No integration with system profiling tools

**Opportunity**: Connect with profiling ecosystem:
- Perf integration for CPU analysis
- Valgrind integration for memory analysis  
- Flamegraph generation
- Cache miss analysis

**Implementation**: Add `profiling_integration` feature
