//! Example usage of deterministic rand with parallel iterators.
//!
//! Monte Carlo method for approximate value of PI.
//!
//! To address the non-determinism caused by parallelism, HRNG create a child random number generator for each dataflow lane. The key is to tie the generator not to the thread ID but to the batch ID. This ensures that no matter which thread handles the job, the sequence of random numbers remains consistent and is determined solely by the batch ID.
//!
//! Internally, a hierarchical random number generator employs a dedicated RNG to produce offspring. This ensures consistent outcomes regardless of when a child generator is created. Additionally, this approach enhances performance by minimizing concurrent clashes between the parent and child generators over shared resources.
//!
//! If you don't have batch ID consider enumerating your items to and use key as batch ID.
