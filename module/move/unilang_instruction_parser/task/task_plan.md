# Task Plan: Refactor Parser for Robustness and Specification Adherence

### Goal
*   To refactor the `unilang_instruction_parser` to be more robust, maintainable, and strictly compliant with the parsing rules in `spec.md`. This involves simplifying the parser engine by improving the token classification layer and then implementing a correct state machine driven by specific, specification-based tests.

### Critique of Previous Plan & Codebase
*   **Architectural Contradiction:** The current `parser_engine.rs` implements a complex manual tokenizer, which contradicts the `spec.md` mandate to use `strs_tools` as the core tokenization engine. This adds unnecessary complexity and potential for bugs.
*   **Insufficient Abstraction:** The parser engine's state machine is not fully driven by the token `kind` from `item_adapter.rs`, often inspecting raw strings instead. This makes the logic less clear and harder to maintain.
*   **Vague Testing Strategy:** The previous plan lacked specific, failing test cases for each rule in the specification, making it difficult to verify full compliance.

### Ubiquitous Language (Vocabulary)
*   **`GenericInstruction`**: The primary output of the parser.
*   **`Command Path`**: The initial sequence of dot-separated identifiers that names the command.
*   **`RichItem` / `UnilangTokenKind`**: The classified token produced by `item_adapter.rs`. This should be the primary input for the parser's state machine.
*   **`spec.md`**: The canonical source of truth for parsing rules.

### Progress
*   **Roadmap Milestone:** N/A (Bug fix to unblock `unilang`'s M3.1)
*   **Primary Editable Crate:** `module/move/unilang_instruction_parser`
*   **Overall Progress:** Paused, awaiting `strs_tools` fix
*   **Increment Status:**
    *   ✅ Increment 1: Refactor Token Classification and Simplify Engine
    *   ⚫ Increment 2: Create MRE and Local Patch for `strs_tools` (Blocked by `strs_tools` bug)
    *   ⚫ Increment 3: Fix Unescaping and Re-enable Tests (Blocked by `strs_tools` bug)
    *   ⚫ Increment 4: Add Comprehensive, Failing Spec-Adherence Tests (Blocked by `strs_tools` bug)
    *   ⚫ Increment 5: Implement Correct Parser State Machine (Blocked by `strs_tools` bug)
    *   ⚫ Increment 6: Finalization (Blocked by `strs_tools` bug)

### Permissions & Boundaries
*   **Mode:** code
*   **Run workspace-wise commands:** false
*   **Add transient comments:** true
*   **Additional Editable Crates:** None

### Relevant Context
*   Control Files to Reference:
    *   `module/move/unilang/spec.md`
*   Files to Include:
    *   `src/parser_engine.rs`
    *   `src/item_adapter.rs`
    *   `tests/`
*   External Crates Requiring `task.md` Proposals: 
    *   `module/core/strs_tools`

### Expected Behavior Rules / Specifications
*   The parser must correctly implement all rules in `spec.md`, Section 2.4 "Parsing Rules and Precedence".
*   **Rule 1 (Command Path):** The longest possible sequence of dot-separated identifiers at the start of an expression is the command path.
*   **Rule 2 (Transition to Args):** The path ends when a non-identifier/non-dot token is found (e.g., `::`, `?`, quoted string).
*   **Rule 3 (Dots):** Leading dots are ignored. Trailing dots on a command path are a syntax error.
*   **Rule 4 (Help):** `?` must be the final token.
*   All existing tests must continue to pass.

### Crate Conformance Check Procedure
*   Step 1: Execute `timeout 90 cargo test -p unilang_instruction_parser --all-targets` via `execute_command`.
*   Step 2: Analyze `execute_command` output. If it fails, initiate Critical Log Analysis.
*   Step 3: If tests pass, execute `timeout 90 cargo clippy -p unilang_instruction_parser -- -D warnings` via `execute_command`.
*   Step 4: Analyze `execute_command` output. If it fails, initiate Linter Fix & Regression Check Procedure.

### Increments

##### Increment 1: Refactor Token Classification and Simplify Engine
*   **Goal:** To simplify the parser by replacing the manual, error-prone tokenizer in `parser_engine.rs` with the architecturally-mandated `strs_tools` crate. This creates a clean, simple foundation for implementing the correct parsing logic.
*   **Commit Message:** "refactor(parser): Simplify tokenization via item_adapter"

##### Increment 2: Create MRE and Local Patch for `strs_tools`
*   **Goal:** To isolate the unescaping bug in `strs_tools`, create a local patch with a fix, and configure the project to use this patch, unblocking the parser development.
*   **Specification Reference:** N/A (Tooling bug fix)
*   **Steps:** (Blocked by `strs_tools` bug)
*   **Increment Verification:** (Blocked by `strs_tools` bug)
*   **Commit Message:** (Blocked by `strs_tools` bug)

##### Increment 3: Fix Unescaping and Re-enable Tests
*   **Goal:** To resolve the unescaping bug identified in Increment 1 by fully delegating unescaping to the patched `strs_tools`, re-enabling the disabled tests, and ensuring all existing tests pass, creating a stable foundation for further development.
*   **Specification Reference:** N/A (Bug fix)
*   **Steps:** (Blocked by `strs_tools` bug)
*   **Increment Verification:** (Blocked by `strs_tools` bug)
*   **Commit Message:** (Blocked by `strs_tools` bug)

##### Increment 4: Add Comprehensive, Failing Spec-Adherence Tests
*   **Goal:** To create a new test suite that codifies the specific parsing rules from `spec.md`, Section 2.4. These tests are designed to fail with the current logic, proving its non-conformance and providing clear targets for the next increment.
*   **Rationale:** A test-driven approach is the most reliable way to ensure full compliance with a specification. By writing tests that fail first, we define the exact required behavior and can be confident the implementation is correct when the tests pass.
*   **Steps:** (Blocked by `strs_tools` bug)
*   **Increment Verification:** (Blocked by `strs_tools` bug)
*   **Commit Message:** (Blocked by `strs_tools` bug)

##### Increment 5: Implement Correct Parser State Machine
*   **Goal:** To modify the state machine in `src/parser_engine.rs` to correctly implement the specification rules, making the new tests pass.
*   **Rationale:** This is the core fix. With a simplified token stream from Increment 1 and clear failing tests from Increment 2, we can now implement the correct parsing logic with confidence.
*   **Steps:** (Blocked by `strs_tools` bug)
*   **Increment Verification:** (Blocked by `strs_tools` bug)
*   **Commit Message:** (Blocked by `strs_tools` bug)

##### Increment 6: Finalization
*   **Goal:** Perform a final, holistic review and verification of the entire task's output, ensuring all tests pass and the crate is clean.
*   **Rationale:** This final quality gate ensures that the fixes did not introduce any regressions and that the crate meets all project standards.
*   **Steps:** (Blocked by `strs_tools` bug)
*   **Increment Verification:** (Blocked by `strs_tools` bug)
*   **Commit Message:** (Blocked by `strs_tools` bug)
