//! # MRE Test: Path Parsing with Dots
//!
//! This module contains a Minimal Reproducible Example (MRE) test case
//! for a specific bug where `unilang_parser` incorrectly tokenized file paths
//! containing dots (e.g., `/tmp/.tmpQ0DwU0/temp_file.txt`).
//!
//! **Problem:** The parser's `strs_tools::split` configuration initially treated `.` as a delimiter,
//! causing paths like `/tmp/.test.file` to be split into multiple tokens (`/tmp/`, `.`, `test`, `.`, `file`).
//! This led to `Syntax("Unexpected token '.' in arguments")` errors when parsing such paths as argument values.
//!
//! **Solution:** The `parse_arguments` function in `parser_engine.rs` was modified to
//! intelligently re-assemble these split path segments into a single argument value.
//! This involves consuming subsequent `.` delimiters and their following segments
//! if they appear within what is identified as an argument value.
//!
//! This test ensures that the fix correctly handles such paths and prevents regression.
