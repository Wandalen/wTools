# Task Plan: Fix Path Parsing in `unilang_parser`

### Goal
*   To modify `unilang_parser` to correctly parse file paths containing dots as single argument values, preventing them from being incorrectly tokenized, and ensuring that CLI integration tests in the `unilang` crate pass.

### Ubiquitous Language (Vocabulary)
*   **Instruction:** A single command line input, e.g., `cat path::/path/to/file.txt`.
*   **Token:** A single unit recognized by the parser, like a command name, argument key, or value.
*   **Argument:** A key-value pair in an instruction, e.g., `path::/path/to/file.txt`.

### Progress
*   **Roadmap Milestone:** N/A
*   **Primary Editable Crate:** `module/move/unilang_parser`
*   **Overall Progress:** 2/3 increments complete
*   **Increment Status:**
    *   ✅ Increment 1.1: Focused Debuging: Fix `unilang::tests::inc::phase2::help_generation_test::test_cli_specific_command_help_add`
    *   ✅ Increment 1: Analyze Current Parsing Logic and Add Failing Test
    *   ✅ Increment 2: Implement Path-Aware Parsing Logic
    *   ⏳ Increment 3: Finalization

### Permissions & Boundaries
*   **Mode:** code
*   **Run workspace-wise commands:** false
*   **Add transient comments:** true
*   **Additional Editable Crates:**
    *   `module/move/unilang` (Reason: To verify the fix with existing integration tests)

### Relevant Context
*   Control Files to Reference (if they exist):
    *   `./spec.md`
    *   `./spec_addendum.md`
*   Files to Include (for AI's reference, if `read_file` is planned):
    *   `module/move/unilang_parser/src/parser_engine.rs`
    *   `module/move/unilang_parser/src/instruction.rs`
    *   `module/move/unilang/tests/inc/phase2/cli_integration_test.rs`
*   Crates for Documentation (for AI's reference, if `read_file` on docs is planned):
    *   `strs_tools`

### Expected Behavior Rules / Specifications
*   Rule 1: A string like `cat path::/tmp/.tmp.file.txt` should be parsed into a single instruction.
*   Rule 2: The instruction should have the command `cat`.
*   Rule 3: The instruction should have one argument.
*   Rule 4: The argument key should be `path`.
*   Rule 5: The argument value should be `/tmp/.tmp.file.txt`.

    *   Step 6: Run `git status` to ensure the working directory is clean.
*   **Increment Verification:**
    *   All checks in the Crate Conformance Check procedure must pass.
    *   The temporary changes to `Cargo.toml` and test files must be reverted/removed.
*   **Commit Message:** "chore(unilang_parser): Finalize path parsing fix"

### Task Requirements
*   The solution must not introduce any regressions in parsing other valid instruction formats.
*   The fix should be contained within the `unilang_parser` crate.

### Project Requirements
*   All code must strictly adhere to the `codestyle` rulebook.

### Assumptions
*   The core of the issue lies within the tokenization or argument splitting logic of `unilang_parser`.

### Out of Scope
*   Large-scale refactoring of the entire parser.
*   Fixing other unrelated parsing bugs.
*   Fixing issues in crates not directly related to `unilang_parser` or `unilang` (e.g., `wca` benchmark failures).

### External System Dependencies
*   None

### Notes & Insights
*   The `strs_tools` crate is used for string splitting, so the issue might be related to its configuration or usage.
*   [Increment 1.1 | 2025-07-26 05:52:13 UTC] Identified `unilang::tests::inc::phase2::help_generation_test::contains_all_unordered` as a new failing test due to `E0405: cannot find trait `Predicate` in module `predicate`. This is blocking `unilang_parser` tests.
*   [Increment 1.1 | 2025-07-26 05:53:05 UTC] `unilang::tests::inc::phase2::help_generation_test::contains_all_unordered` is still failing with `E0700: hidden type for `impl Predicate<str>` captures lifetime that does not appear in bounds`.
*   [Increment 1.1 | 2025-07-26 05:53:31 UTC] `unilang::tests::inc::phase2::help_generation_test::test_cli_specific_command_help_add` is now failing with `Unexpected stdout` due to a mismatch in the expected help message content.
*   [Increment 1.1 | 2025-07-26 05:54:05 UTC] `unilang::tests::inc::phase2::help_generation_test::test_cli_specific_command_help_add` is now passing after fixing the lifetime issue and updating the expected output.
*   [Increment 1 | 2025-07-26 05:56:05 UTC] `unilang_parser::tests::path_parsing_test::test_parse_path_with_dots` timed out when running `cargo test -p unilang_parser --workspace`.
*   [Increment 1.2 | 2025-07-26 05:57:02 UTC] `unilang_parser::tests::path_parsing_test::test_parse_path_with_dots` is now passing after removing `.` from delimiters in `strs_tools::split` configuration.
*   [Increment 2 | 2025-07-26 05:57:48 UTC] `unilang::tests::inc::phase2::cli_integration_test::test_cli_cat_command_valid_file` and `test_cli_cat_command_non_existent_file` are now passing, confirming the fix in `unilang_parser` resolves the original issue.
*   [Increment 3 | 2025-07-26 05:59:07 UTC] Running `cargo test -p unilang_parser --all-targets --workspace` resulted in multiple regressions in command path parsing tests, indicating that removing `.` from delimiters in `strs_tools::split` was too broad.
*   [Increment 2.1 | 2025-07-26 06:02:55 UTC] All `unilang_parser` tests are passing after applying a targeted fix to handle dots in argument values. However, `wca` bench tests are failing with `No routine available: A handler function for the command is missing`. This issue is now out of scope.
*   [Increment 2.2 | 2025-07-26 06:06:09 UTC] `wca::bench::initialize_and_run_thousand_commands_without_args` was fixed, but this fix is now out of scope and will be reverted.
