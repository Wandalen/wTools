#### entity

Within the "entity" directory reside common modules utilized across various actions within the project. These modules encapsulate shared functionalities and data structures integral to the project's operations, promoting modularity and code reuse.

#### tool

In the "tool" directory, you'll find modules designed for broader utility beyond the confines of the project itself. These modules may offer functionalities or tools that can be leveraged independently or integrated into other projects beyond the scope of the current endeavor.

This structured organization enhances clarity, maintainability, and scalability within the project, facilitating efficient development and collaboration among team members.
