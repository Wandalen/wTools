# Crates: Architectural Layer Map

Workspace crate inventory organized by architectural dependency layer.
Layers are ordered bottom-up: lower layers have fewer internal dependencies; higher layers depend on lower ones.

## Layer Summary

| L# | Name | Count | Domain |
|----|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Foundation | 3 | Error handling, diagnostics, memory |
| 2 | Primitives | 9 | Bytes, rand, type checks, intervals, time |
| 3 | Macro Framework | 11 | All proc-macro (`_meta`) crates + macro_tools |
| 4 | Patterns | 11 | Builder, module org, clone dyn, reflect, component model |
| 5 | Collections | 6 | Containers, iterators, async traits |
| 6 | String & Format | 8 | Strings, colors, data display, markdown, type aggregation |
| 7 | Path & Process | 7 | Paths, filesystem, processes, workspace, config |
| 8 | Tooling | 8 | Testing, benchmarking, genfile, CLI, crates analysis |
| 9 | Application | 5 | willbe, unitore, sqlx, aggregators |

Total: 68 crates (0 alias + 28 core + 19 deprecated + 21 experimental)
Note: 22 additional legacy crates (formerly in `module/postponed/`) are co-located in `module/deprecated/` but have no layer assignments and are excluded from this table.

## Crate Layer Assignments

**Column legend:**

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Crate` | Crate name as published on crates.io |
| `Module` | Source directory under `module/`: `alias`, `core`, `deprecated`, or `experimental` |
| `L#` | Layer number (1 = lowest / most foundational, 9 = highest / most application-facing) |
| `Layer` | Layer name from the Layer Summary table |
| `Purpose` | One-sentence statement of what the crate does for its callers |
| `Deps` | Total runtime `[dependencies]` count (excludes `[dev-dependencies]` and `[build-dependencies]`) |
| `Int` | Subset of `Deps` that are internal workspace crates (identified by `workspace = true`) |
| `=L` | Internal deps on crates in the **same** layer — lateral coupling |
| `↓L` | Internal deps on crates in **lower** layers — expected, healthy flow |
| `↑L` | Internal deps on crates in **higher** layers — architectural violation; should be zero |
| `State` | Current lifecycle: `stable` (mature, actively used), `experimental` (API may change), `deprecated` (slated for removal) |
| `Target` | Desired lifecycle (same values as State); delta from State shows required action |
| `Readiness` | Quality criteria met: `T`ested, `D`ocumented, `C`lean (↑L=0), `F`eatures (default=[]), `R`eadme, `E`xamples, `M`arkers clean, `S`table deps; `·` = not met |

## Crate Profiles

Per-crate attributes for promotion and publishing.

**Schema:**
- **module** — source directory under `module/`: `alias`, `core`, `deprecated`, or `experimental`
- **layer** — layer number and name from the Layer Summary table
- **state** — current lifecycle: `stable` (mature, actively used), `experimental` (API may change), `deprecated` (slated for removal)
- **target** — desired lifecycle (same values as state); when state ≠ target, action is needed
- **readiness** — quality criteria met: `T`ested, `D`ocumented, `C`lean (↑L=0), `F`eatures (default=[]), `R`eadme, `E`xamples, `M`arkers clean, `S`table deps; `·` = not met
- **purpose** — one-sentence statement matching the Crate Layer Assignments table
- **deps** / **int** / **=L** / **↓L** / **↑L** — dep stats matching the Crate Layer Assignments columns
- **version** — current version from Cargo.toml; tracks release state
- **no_std** — whether the `no_std` feature is declared in Cargo.toml
- **keywords** — up to 5 crates.io search terms; recommended values for optimal discovery
- **categories** — up to 2 crates.io browse paths
- **pitch** — one sentence written for a potential adopter on crates.io

**Excluded:** `license` (all MIT, no signal), `msrv` (all workspace 1.61, no signal), `published` (none set `publish = false`; live status requires crates.io API), `docs`/`homepage` (fully derivable: `docs.rs/{name}`, GitHub repo path).
